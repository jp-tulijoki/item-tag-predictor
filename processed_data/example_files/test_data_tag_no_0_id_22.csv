6537,"A real letdown (possible spoilers); I adored the first two Terminator movies.  I saw the first one 10 years ago, and the second one a little while later.  I was excited at first, but had a couple misgivings.  I knew from the beginning that Linda Hamilton wouldn't be in T3, and that John Connor would be played by someone else.  I should have followed my gut and not seen this. Nothing is explained in this movie, like what the T-X was made of, exactly. There was, I guess, a need for a sequel, because the first two movies created a paradox.  If they really had stopped Judgment Day, they couldn't have done it.  That is, if in T2 they stopped it, there would be no terminators, no reason to send Kyle Reese through time in the first movie, no John Connor, no damaged CPU to build Skynet on--you get the idea.  If they had really stopped the future, John Connor couldn't exist and Sarah Connor would still be working as a waitress.  What I don't get is why the terminators got sent back in the first place.  Obviously, the reason they got sent back was because John Connor was there.  Since he was there, didn't that mean they failed in the first place, so sending back machines was useless?  Anyway... Back to the movie.  Yes, there were some great action sequences, but all it really did was illustrate (badly) what had to happen anyway, if you just thought about it.  It's a great movie franchise, but it's built on absolute impossibilities, not just pretend A.I. I'd give this movie a 4 out of 10.  IF YOU LIKED THE FIRST TWO, STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!!!",0.0
8874,"Why is this in the Top 250???; I was thoroughly disappointed with this stupid movie. I love great, good, and OK movies and this didn't really register. Four of us watched this and we laughed maybe 10 times during the whole film. Most of it was unintelligent, predictable as all hell, and plain not funny. I love UK office but was sorry to see Dawn in a stupid role, and Tim for 5 seconds doing nothing. I really don't know how people think the director is so great. Believe me, I got the clever jokes when they were present, unfortunately it was mostly a ""fuck, why are you doing that??"" fest. I hate comedy's that are full of phony circumstance when it could easily have been written to be consistently clever. If you have an above average IQ and love funny, don't watch this boring Jay and Silent Bob level piece of crap. To be fair, it's not complete crap, it just kinda sucked. P.S. I laughed around 10 times for every Jay and Silent Bob movie as well.",0.0
2571,"Little Buddha meets Johnny Mnemonic; There you have, when Keanu was running out of characters, he turned on the blender and ""zooop"", instant sci-fi high-tech thriller with some 'deja vu'. Visually astonishing as any sci-fi mainstream movie today, a half of the movie trying to explain us (and Keanu) what's this all about: this is not the real world. Well, if i have to choose... Shades of Woo style on the gun-to-gun and all the firing-gun scenes, shades of the Kung Fu series, the usually great Fishburne and the f/x feast and the promise of a sequel. A new hero for next milennium. We all can be the messiah by having a comfortable pc plugged to a telephone line. Cinema? That's another story.",0.0

3751,"I've Never Heard so Many Poultry Puns; I would say it's a hoot, but it's about chickens, and a cluck just doesn't do it. In this masterwork of modern claymation, a flock of chickens realize that their World War II concentration camp setting is going result in all of them becoming dinner. Along comes Mel Gibson as a chicken (I suppose after saving the Colonies in ""The Patriot"" he needed other things to do. Anyway, the chickens are soon empowered to try to save themselves with the help of Mel. They become industrious. They already have some pretty amazing anthropomorphic talents, but trying to escape has not been one of them. They are ruled over by the Tweedys, a clumsy husband and wife team who start to realize what is happening. Because they are not doing well in the egg business, they buy a pie machine with the thought of butchering their animals and making them into pies. So the chips are down. Great animation and a really interesting premise.",0.875
903,"Not his best by far; For the most part, this suspense thriller from Hitchcock the master of the genre, seems a fairly run-of-the-mill affair. However, thanks to the usual directorial touches and a fascinating final act, along with some top notch performances most notably from James Stewart, it manages to lift itself above first impressions. The story concerns Stewart's retired police officer being hired by old college friend to tail his wife (the quite wonderful Kim Novak), whom he claims has been possessed by her grandmother. As he becomes involved in this mystifying scenario, Stewart finds himself falling in love with his quarry and elects to try and help solve her paranormal problems. The film really comes into it's own in the last half hour or so, which is hard to describe without revealing too much, but gives a fascinating portrayal of a desperate man and the hurt that can come of a doomed relationship. I wasn't too happy with the ending (surely nun's aren't that scary?) but all in all this has a dark psychological edge which could have been explored further and makes for an interesting watch. Plus now I know the film playing in the cinema in 'Twelve Monkeys'.",0.0

66097,"Absolutely unacceptable for children, unimaginative and locked in clichés; This movie was a great, great disappointment, and we are at a complete loss on how it has earned the generally good reviews everywhere. The story is a dull and hap-hazard patchwork of truly imaginative fairy tails, lesser imaginative children's stories and other bad copies of true classics. But more importantly, it is in absolutely no way suited for children. It is deeply rooted in the genre of horror movies and makes ample use of fear-producing settings and techniques. Starting off in a clumsily drawn situation many children can relate to - being misunderstood by their parents - it begins to address the topic of imagination as a helper in difficult situations. Here, a wonderful opportunity lay at hand to in pictures talk to children about the themes of emotional over-strain and retreat and the dangers that are associated with it. However, the movie from then on completely fails to make use of this possibility and regresses into an imbecile fight against a fuzzily, badly painted antagonist. This antagonist is anything but stringent, it switches back and forth between different clichés and it is obvious that the makers of this movie do not have any creativity in themselves at all to create a coherent vision. To make up for this lack of imagination, the movie is filled up to the rim with horror scenes, much too much for anyone below 14 at least, I would say. Even my partner and me were stunned by such an unnecessary use of fear-creating. The psychological insight of the creators does not go any further than randomly inserting some references to the constructive and destructive side of love. When you think that you completely wasted your money, it gets even worse, as the story is from a possible closing again forced into a second rising, giving additional prove of the complete loss of creative vision and inability of storytelling of the makers. It is a disgrace how this movie is presented as being in the tradition of Alice, Amelie, or others. It is not. Do not pay to be made sit through a complete failure.",0.0

5816,"The best film of the year!...but MORE RICKMAN P L E A S E!!!; (A few spoilers.) Now, this is what Chris Columbus has said: 'The first film I wanted more Alan Rickman...the second film I wanted more Alan Rickman'...soooo, what's the problem then??? Just give the man more screen time for God sake, 'cause he's incredibly talented (the best actor on earth in fact) and he's just BRILLIANT as Snape!!!!! Anyway, I LOVED this film!!! I loved the first one as well, but this film was even better. (I'm 20 by the way...) All the newcomers do a terrific job. Isaacs and Branagh are superb...in fact the whole cast is just OUTSTANDING! All of them! And Dobby...WOW! Exactly as I had imagined him to be. And the film is definitely NOT too long! During the whole film I kept looking at the watch, afraid that the film would soon be over. The scenery was once again awesome and the special effects were amazing. I missed a few scenes though...for example the one where Snape turns up behind Harry and Ron from nowhere and forces them to follow him to his office. And the one where Harry, without being seen, throws a firework in Snape's class. The firework explodes in Goyle's potion and half of the students get hit by Swelling Solution. However, the magic is there, the humour is there, the action is there, and the film is darker - just as the book! Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is without a doubt the best film I've seen so far this year. I wanted more Snape...but I give CoS 10 stars out of 10 anyway!!! ",0.0
6493,"Adorable, romantic, so much fun!; ""Alex&Emma"" was one of the sweetest movies I've ever seen. It was a definate chick flick, but probably a great date movie too! Kate Hudson, probably the cutest actress right now, did a terrific job in her various roles! She's the kind of person you want to hug and hug and never let go! And Luke Wilson was just awesome! The two have beautiful chemistry and I'd love to see more movies with those two! If you enjoyed Kate in ""How To Loose a Guy In 10 Days"" then I definatly reccomend ""Alex&Emma"", but even if you just want a fun movie watching night, you should see this one! It's laugh out loud funny, it makes you feel for the characters, its the perfect romantic comedy! YAY!",0.0
527,"Quite Possibly the Greatest Movie Ever Made; I was a die-hard ""Citizen Kane"" fan. I would defend the film as often as possible, and if I were to watch a movie that was considered a classic the main comparison would be to ""Citizen Kane"". ""Schindler's List"" transcends ""Citizen Kane"" in brilliant film-making and acting, however. Its pure believable humanity has such effectiveness that people can be changed by its horrors, drama, and feel-good appeal. Suspense has never been at the level throughout movies as it is in ""Schindler's List"". Hitchcock made some suspenseful movies, especially ""Rear Window"", but the Auchwitz scene in this film has suspense on a level I have never seen before. The elements of horror, drama, suspense, and especially humanity throughout this movie are enough to make it comparable to ""Citizen Kane"". However, what makes it better are the stellar performances given by every actor throughout the performance. Liam Neeson is brilliant as Oskar Schindler, and he becomes Mr. Schindler in such a way that other actors throughout cinematic history would have died for to achieve. Even better is Ralph Finnes as Amon Goeth, a man just as vicious as Hitler who was portrayed in one of the great film performances in history. The only reason this movie does not have the same regard as films such as ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane"" is because it is so young. Thirteen years is not enough time for a movie to age the same way movies such as the classics of the 30s and 40s evolved into what they are today. In another 40 years however, Schindler's list will be among the company of ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Casablanca"". This is my pick for the greatest film ever made.",0.0
1246,"good until the boys become cowards; About five kids with no balls who could only make poetic gestures, which, by the way, were totally ineffectual, to stand-up for themselves and for what was right.  Yes, it can be inspirational, until you see how lame the kids are and how each one of them had the opportunity, especially the main character, to speak their mind, stand up for themselves, and for what is right...but they don't really do that.  Williams is very good in the role of John Keating, but then you also ask yourself what a guy like Keating would be doing in a school like that.",0.0
38038,"Fun, but I still prefer Creature Comforts; The first feature length outing for Wallace and Gromit sees them in the vegetable-protection industry. As AntiPesto they specialise in keeping the village's prized vegetables safe from the ever hungry mouths of rabbits. In a humane manner. The Annual Giant Vegetable Show is only a few days away when the Were-Rabbit makes an appearance. Destruction of many much-loved vegetables occurs, and AntiPesto also have to deal with Victor Quartermaine who believes that the gun would be much more useful in dealing with the problem than any of Wallace's methods. Through in a bit of a love story, not to mention a weight loss problem, and you've got the essence of this film's plot. And anyone who hasn't seen any of Park's previous work may be surprised at exactly how much plasticine can convey. This is a really enjoyable film. There is plenty of humour to keep you smiling, and at only 85 mins even the younger children should be able to sit through it without too much trouble. There are plenty of allusions to other films, especially were-wolf ones. And we've get our first homage to King Kong though I'm guessing that Jackson's one will be slightly longer. There is also a short before the main feature, starring the penguins from Madagascar. I didn't hugely enjoy that film, but the penguins were great, and here they are just as funny.",1.0

5540,"Mythology extravaganza; It is quite remarkable that in this age of CGI, the stop-motion creations of Ray Harryhausen remain a charming, if quite dated sight. This is none more evident than in the mythology-based features he produced and created the visual effects for. Which is why Clash of the Titans, though directed by Desmond Davis, is commonly (and justly) attributed to Harryhausen. Loosely based on the myth of Perseus (played by future L.A. Law star Harry Hamlin), the film depicts the hero's struggles against many supernatural beings to save the beautiful Andromeda (Judi Bowker). Pulling the strings is the goddess Thetis (Maggie Smith), who explicitly disobeys the orders of Zeus (Laurence Olivier) for personal reasons. Luckily, Perseus gets some help in the shape of a mentor (Burgess Meredith), a winged horse named Pegasus and a mechanical owl called Bubo... Yes, the owl is nowhere to be found in the Greek myths, but then again, neither is the Kraken, one of the monsters the protagonist has to defeat. This is, of course, totally acceptable because Clash of the Titans never intended to please mythology scholars. Instead, it sets out to be an exciting ride, involving great adventures, dangers and a little romance. Inevitably, what worked back in 1981 doesn't always translate as well more than two decades later. Impressive as they may be (Medusa deserves a special mention), Harryhausen's creatures pale next to ILM's achievements in Raiders of the Lost Ark, which was released the same year, and Bubo really is a bit ridiculous with his R2-D2 sound effects (though the makers of the film claim that was an unfortunate coincidence). As for the acting, only Olivier and Smith (and, to a lesser extent, Meredith) provide what can be called solid thesping: it is painfully obvious that the likes of Hamlin, Boker and Ursula Andress were cast for their looks rather than their talent. Nevertheless, one thing the movie never forgets is to be fun, even it if does veer close to extreme camp at times. But hey, no one ever really expected a mythology-based action film to deal with major issues and have a compelling dramatic core, right? This is a cheap yet charming adventure, and should not be viewed as anything else.",0.0
4326,"Overview on Mississippi Burning; Mississippi Burning Directed by Alan Parker, Mississippi Burning (1988) tells the story about a small town turned upside down by the FBI coming there to investigate the disappearance of three young men. The movie deals with harsh reality of racism in the South of USA. It is set in 1964 when racial segregation blossomed and blacks were seen as a lower class. The movie evokes sympathy and knowing that it's based on true story and true events it really gets the viewer thinking: ""How could these things have happened?"" The main characters are the two agents from the North of USA investigating the crime and the members of the Ku Klux Klan. The agents are very different from each other but have the same goal to solve the crime. Through the investigations the truth of the widely spread violence committed against the blacks by the white racists is revealed to the agents. The difference between the North and the South is highlighted as the agents are using methods that question the traditional cultural norms in solving the crime, like interviewing the black people. Another interesting character in the movie is Mrs Pell, wife of a sheriff who is a member of Ku Klux Klan. Mr Anderson, the other agent and her go through interesting conversations in the movie. Mrs Pell, like most white people in the town is brought up teaching that whites a better people than blacks. She says hate isn't born it's taught. In the end the killers are caught and they are convicted to prison.",0.0
2571,"Koia Ali; The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come. Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated. But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The King-fun sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out. People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the boatmen is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think. Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time.",0.0
2302,"The more I watch it --- the funnier it gets!!; Definitely one of my all-time favorite comedies. Well directed, well acted -- priceless comic performances by Pesci, Tomei, Gwynne & Austin Pendleton. And more than comedy -- there's also a lot of genuine pathos and real tension and drama, especially in the final courtroom scene. And I really don't understand the ""controversy"" or brouhaha over Marisa Tomei receiving the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in this movie. It's a crackerjack gem of a performance and a stellar comic portrayal. The only thing I can figure is that a lot of snobbery about serious dramatic portrayals somehow being more worthy of honor than great comic performances still very much lives on in much of the film community.",0.0

With the additional voices of Steve Buscemi and John Ratzenberger (as the Agreeable Snowman), this is a great story of monsters in the closet... turned upside down. In this version, monsters only scare children because it generates electricity, and the monsters actually fear children, believing them to be toxic. Of Pixar's films, this is definitely one of the more iconic and memorable, right up there with ""Toy Story"".

4388,"They´ve got Tim Curry, and no RHPS joke?! CONTAINS SPOILERS!; AGAIN, THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS - but since the movie has like no plot or surprises, all it spoils are some jokes I loved Scary Movie. The second installment, well... I´m not so thrilled about. Sure, it had good jokes, but this time, it had a lot of jokes which either were completely unfunny (all those jokes about the handymans hand were SO not funny IMO). When the movie shines and makes you laugh, it WORKS. For example, you know the scene in the trailer ""I hope she doesn´t find out..."" ""Who?"" ""Your wife"". That scene itself is really unfunny, I wonder why they bothered to put it in the trailer, but a joke about one minute after this which builds on that scene had me howling with laughter. And finally - maybe I just didn´t catch it, but with the whole movie having a cast of characters just like Rocky Horror Picture Show (they´ve got a couple, a guy in a wheelchair, some other not-so-important characters, a handyman AND Tim Curry in an old creepy mansion), I was really disappointed that there wasn´t a mock-up of it. If there was one, I didn´t notice it. So, I can´t really recommend this movie. If you liked the first one, go ahead and watch it - you probably won´t be as thrilled as you were with the first one, but you´re pretty much sure to get some good laughs out of it. Oh, finally - if you liked the first Scary Movie but didn´t like this one, you might want to check out ""Shriek (if you know what I did...)"", an (unfortunately) straight-to-video release. It´s a movie I personally liked even more than the first Scary Movie, maybe because it was really low on gross-out jokes. Hey, I liked Can´t Hardly Wait better than American Pie, too... so maybe that´s just me.",0.0

296,"After watching Pulp Fiction, everything else will seem like bread and water...; Often copied but never duplicated, Pulp Fiction was an absolute sensation when it came out in 1994. It became an audience favourite, received universal praise from critics, won the Best Film at the Cannes Film Festival, and made director Quintin Tarantino into a household name. How many films out there can you fit into this category? Pulp Fiction is so famous for several reasons. First off, it's one of the most original films of the 90's. When most movies out there are either remakes, sequels, based on books, or on actual events, Tarantino gives us 2-inch sirloin steak that's bloody as hell. The plot is several stories all interelated in someway or another that weave in and out over a period of about 48 hours (give or take and afternoon) all within the shifty comings and goings of the LA drug life. Each story connects the characters together, like a puzzle within a puzzle, and is all held together strongly with a fantastic cast (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis) and Acadamy Award worthy performances. Secondly, it has tremendous dialogue. Quintin Tarantino is an absolute genius in crafting the film's Oscar winning screenplay. This isn't made up nonsense. This stuff is real. Many of the dialogue you could so easily overhear from the people talking behind you in the grocery line. They're conversations of reality, and this is what helps make the film so good. And when it has to be, the script is sharp as a razor blade in which Samuel L. Jackson deserves much praise for. Thirdly, it is amazingly memorable. Most movies would be lucky to have about 2 memorable scenes; Pulp Fiction has about nine. Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega's fantastic twist dance scene became of the most iconic scenes of the 90's (I will admit I tried a few moves in front of my bedroom mirror). Mia getting stabbed with a syringe makes everyone's knees knock and who doesn't laugh darkly at Winston Wolf's scenes. The acting, the story, the characters, everything just works. That's all as I can describe it. After watching Pulp Fiction, everything else will seem like bread and water. So don't be afraid to watch this wildly outrageous, fantastic, bloody, and often surreal film that turned the 90's upside down. It's all that and a bag of chips. Get out there and rent it.",0.0
48385,"Absolutely and Utterly a Steaming Load of Crap; Ever wonder why Paris Hilton is famous? Has she ever done anything meaningful with her life? Is she brilliant and talented? Is she funny or principled? Is she even modestly attractive? The answer is of course, no, on all counts. But Hilton is famous because somewhere, at sometime, some idiot in a PR firm created the image of Paris Hilton, Hollywood skank and party girl. Like Hilton, Borat is an embarrassing monstrosity of a movie (the worst I've seen in MANY YEARS) that has gained in popularity not because it is good, has a message, or is even slightly funny, but simply because it caters to the lowest common denominator- idiot teenagers. I have never walked out on a movie before in my life, even after seeing some true garbage, but I finally did in Borat (with about 20 minutes to go in the movie). Anyone who finds this mindless, tasteless, low brow, stinking, festering, corrupt, and offensive drivel funny really needs to seek the aid of a professional psychologist. Now, to be fair there are about 15-20 minutes of MILDLY humorous bits in the movie. The rest of the movie is just scatological and homoerotic gibberish devoid of any real meaning or message. One reason I went to see this rubbish was its billing as a political satire  well, it's not in any way, shape or form. The political messages, where they exist at all, are obvious and clumsily handled (for example, the war of terror bit at the rodeo). The movie is totally devoid of social satire, mistaking mean spirited and deceptive pranks for insight into the human condition. The movie is often blatantly offensive, racist, and just plain stupid. Finally, though rated R, this film really needs an NC17 rating- the MPAA must have been asleep at the screening of the movie and any producers out there that have the NC17 label slapped on their movie should be able to point to this train wreck as a prime example of how their rating system is fundamentally flawed. Especially egregious are the close-up photographs of the genitals of an (apparently) under aged male (ha!, that's so funny!). Finally, I'd like to close with saying that Larry Charles and Sacha Cohen are talent less hacks and dolts. With any luck at all these two blathering idiots will sink into total oblivion never to be heard from again to the betterment of the world as a whole (and take their mindless fans with them).",0.0

6537,"Best movie of 2003 IMHO!; I loved this movie. I don't exactly know why I liked it so much, but I think it was just about everything. I liked the second movie, but I that T3 had a higher level of sophistication and maturity as it ought to. There is nothing finer than a well produced movie with a full orchestra and a good, well presented theme. The themes in the first and second movies where transparent and never narrated, but if you look at T3, you will notice that the theme is so prominant that not only is it included in the subtitle just as in the second movie, but also the theme is narrated by John C. which I think is very important for setting a mood and I would say is appropriate in a sci-fi movie such as this one. Throught the whole movie character developement is strong. Arnold's character is used as both a metaphore of total annihilation and a foil for Nick's more fleshy character, John. Briliant. Additionally, the movie has great visuals and the action wasn't so quick that the projector couldn't keep up. The action was however largescale and very exciting while believable. My only beef with this movie is that it was too good to only be 120 minutes long. That's what a lot of people have been complaining about and I think they're 100% right.

I was lucky enough to catch this in theaters opening night.  I had no idea what to expect.  What I got was by far the best SF movie of 90's.  And the best part was, it was the best action movie too. This movie is very loosely based on a Harlan Ellison short story titled ""I have no mouth and I must scream"", considered by many to be one of the classic SF stories.  The characters and plot are completely different, but the basic theme is essentially the same.  Why does the world not seem real?  What is real?  Is this all a dream?  This is certainly not the first time movies have tackled this theme, but it is certainly the first time the theme was handled in this way.  This movie is a very original piece of work.  It's influence will be felt for decades. This movie has a very strong story, great characters, good acting, great special effects, incredible fight scenes, and incredible all around execution.

John Travolta was great acting Vincent Vega, a drug addicted gangster, so was Bruce Willis as Butch, a nearly retired boxer. They actually thought of Sylvester Stallone to act this part first Could have been good as well, thinking about his background acting as a boxer in the Rocky series, but the result with Bruce is just brilliant. My favorite character was for sure Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) who's the ""soul brother"" assassin type, colleague of Vincent Vega. He appears as a very knowledgeable guy who can talk about anything from religion to foot massage, while eating a burger with the left hand and shooting wannabe gangsters with the right handand don't forget the hair-style. He's a BAD man, and he's cool at it. Now the plot Well they kinda all have their own stories but it's all gravitating around the same thing. Vincent and Jules have to get back a case that was stolen from their boss, Marsellus Wallace Then things happen, they make several encounters that cause trouble or bring other characters in the mix But the best is the way Tarantino makes you discover the whole story. I won't discuss it here as it would spoil the fun for those who're gonna watch it for the first time. Just watch the movie to know what I'm talking about. It's really worth your money and time in my opinion. I give it a solid 9 stars (wanted 10 but I thought nothing is perfect so)",0.0

8838,"What a Wonderful Film; Ellen Burstyn gives a superb, Oscar-winning performance in this underrated film by Martin Scorsese. A joy. I've seen it ten times and still love it. Great performances all round, especially by Burstyn, Diane Ladd, Harvey Keitel, Lane Bradbury, Kris Kristofferson, Alfred Lutter, Jodie Foster, Valerie Curtin, and Lelia Goldoni. Picaresque tale of sudden widow who decides to follow her dream--with a 12-year-old-boy in tow. Episodic film has high moments and low and the acting is so good. Burstyn gives a career-defining turn here. Can't even imagine another actress who could have done this part. And in 1974 we still had a bevy of star actresses. The character of Alice is so appealing. No one writes parts like this now. And skanks like Jennifer Lopez can only DREAM of turning in the performance Burstyn does. Funny and sad and thoroughly engrossing, this film is a winner by an underrated master of American film. In the 70s Burstyn was, with Jane Fonda, the best actress in films. No one could put over an emotional performance like Burstyn. In this film and films like Resurrection, Ellen Burstyn was able to wear her emotions on the her skin. Just remarkable. Ladd and Curtin are also terrific and funnier than hell.",0.0

It has come to be a sort of common understanding that Matrix contains some philosophical truth or even reasoning. However, this is not the case. The theme of this movie is extremely unoriginal and it's attempts to discuss philosophy is a blunt self-blow. But, this movie is suitable for people who feel ashame of the fact that they are incapable of understanding more complicated films. Therefore it has come to be a consent between viewers of lower intellectual ability to evoke this film as soon as philosophy is mentioned. It is plainly speaking a film for people who doesn't like films in particular but needs something to cling on in conversations about film. Quite pathetic really. A consent of stupidity.",0.0

296,"Complex and confronting, but still a masterpiece; In the minds of most people, Pulp Fiction is a collection of recycled movie scenes, punctuated by extreme violence, 70's music, and pop culture references. That's supposedly all it takes to make a Quentin Tarantino movie. Yet, how many movies have there been since which have copied this ""formula"" that are as fresh, energetic, alive and exciting? None. Pulp Fiction remains the best movie of the 1994, and perhaps the decade. Director and co-writer Quentin Tarantino is courteous enough to credit the viewer with some intelligence. As in his previous ""Reservoir Dogs"", he and writer Roger Avary create a web of events and characters that ultimately all play parts of a larger story, they connect. This time the tale is far more sprawling and complex, but it also rewards and satisfies. Every actor in Pulp Fiction gives a career-topping performance in every role (has Bruce Willis ever been better? Uma Thurman, she was great in Kill Bill though). Travolta especially shines, back in top form after years of bad movies. His smooth, underconfident junkie Vincent Vega is our link to all three stories. He ""plays"" a different character depending on who he's on screen with. He talks jivey when on screen with Jules, cool when with Mia Wallace, and tough in his brief scene with Butch. He doesn't have the confidence to be himself at any time. It's a great performance. When Vincent and Jules begin the movie by hassling the three young cons, they ""get into character"" before entering the room. Jackson is mesmerizing as Jules, fearsome and religious. Frank Whaley, Steve Buscemi, Peter Green, and Christopher Walken also appear in bit parts. Overall, not for the squeamish and light hearted, but not to be written off or underestimated, this is riveting and discomforting storytelling. It can be a difficult, rattling experience, but this reviewer has found its rewards to vastly outweigh its weaknesses, Pulp Fiction is a landmark film and the director has created a wonderfully, rich, diverse satire of violence and campy black humor...combined with a awesome soundtrack.

903,A typical Hitchcock movie; A typical Hitchcock movie. But not up to the mark of other Hitchcock movies. At times we get the feeling that the scenes are too slow or prolonged more than what is required. What the Judie does in the end is enough to give a shock at the end of the movie but does have a bad effect on the movie. It doesn't make much sense that she suddenly jumps out. And most important the necklace that gives away the mystery is not very convincing. It was too stupid of Judie to wear it for a dinner with Scott. Overall a typical Hitchcock movie which can keep the viewers thinking. I will give a rating of 7 out of 10 for this movie. I have seen better Hitchcock movies.,0.0

5214,"Still Stands Up; I was a little apprehensive renting the DVD of this movie after all of these years since its original release, but most of it holds up remarkably well. On the DVD commentary tract, the makers of the film, looking back on it after 25 years, seem to be equally as surprised.  The director, Carl Reiner, points to an eight-minute scene in which it is just Denver and Burns talking in a bathroom.  There is no music, no fast cuts, no special effects, and the scene simply holds our attention on its own.  Mr. Reiner indicates that there is no way that the scene would be made that way today. Some scenes are timeless, such as Jerry's first encounter with the Almighty via intercom in the all-white room.  Also classic is the infamous scene in the bathroom in which God first reveals himself in the flesh to a humbled and still somewhat disbelieving John Denver. Unfortunately, not all of the movie holds up as well.  Some things, especially exteriors, seem very dated.  And even though it is quaint, it is hard to believe that an intelligent and capable husband and wife team would cherish a Supermarket Assistant Manager Job so much.  Ah well, it was another time when people still believed in sticking with one company and working their way up through the ranks. I wish that the film would explore some of the harder questions of religion a little more seriously, but one wonders if the film would collapse if taken out of its sweet, feel-good movie formula in which it is helplessly trapped forever. If anything, rent it for the performances of the two leads.  George Burns, playing the role at 83, is so good, that it is, (not to be cliched,) awesome.  However, what is equally as unbelievable is the performance of John Denver in his first and only acting gig.  He hits some of his notes perfectly, and it really shows a significant skill and timing to play straight man to a legend like Burns. ",0.0

8874,"Real life with a bit of excellent comic scripting makes excellence; After his girlfriend dumps him, loser Shaun (Pegg) must get his life together, only Britain is subjected to an outbreak of zombies that is threatening life all over the world. After the success of TV series Spaced in 2001, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright would continue their rise to the top with the Blood and Ice Cream trilogy with this 2004 release the first instalment to the frankly brilliant saga so far that takes the concept of horror and love to a whole new and tantalizing level. Britain it is fair to say has created sound astounding horror flicks over the years. Danny Boyle's 28 Days later portrayed a horrifying prospect of a country subjected to a rage virus and the director created some breathtaking scenery by deserting the capital for atmospheric purposes. Even Stanley Kubrick's the Shining was filmed partly in Britain and that is perhaps one of the most renowned horrors today, along with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. The last couple of years we have seen more teen horrors than we need from The Hole, to Donkey Punch and recent release Tormented, we get the general picture of teen angst juxtaposed with some blood thank you and so, here, we have a brand new vision, horror with a wonderful spurt of comedy. Shaun of the dead is a rarity, the comic pairing of Frost and Pegg will never be appreciated enough and the quick, very quick, montages of Edgar Wright's bring astounding appreciation to the viewers. The release brings around a wonderful collection of justification to a variety of meaningful topics such as relationships, parenthood, friendship and survival with a wonderful inspirational get your life together ideology. The fact the scripting is hitting hard at some important issues, it would seem hard to cram in any type of comedy, but behold the marvel of the pairing of Pegg and Wright. From throwing classic records at zombies, to the imitations of the dead, this is a comic gem that will consistently make you smile. Pegg and Frost have become one of Britain's best comedy duos with this film the marker in which they hit the big screen in groundbreaking fashion. From Frost's ape impressions to Pegg's likable loser antics, we can sit back and enjoy the partnership and playful banter between the two actors. Wright's direction breaks boundaries with the montages but there is a skillful approach to the handling of the zombie attacks. When outside the Winchester there is a very well handled approach to the way the dead are acting and Wright's sublime setup helps adds a chill and a sweet comic touch. This picture is simply the beginning of the trilogy with Hot Fuzz establishing the actors and directors on to bigger and better things but what a hit Shaun is.",0.0

903,"'Vertigo' is a smart, excellently crafted unconventional mystery with some surprising twists; In 1954, Alfred Hitchcock gained an interest in a French novel entitled The Living and the Dead (or, in French, D'entre les morts), and gained the rights to it before it had even been translated to English. Originally, Madeline was supposed to be played by Vera Miles, but she had to back out due to her pregnancy, and Hitchcock then went with Kim Novak. It took three months to film, and the music was done once again by Bernard Hermann, composer of a lot of Hitchcock's work (including Psycho). When it was first released, it received mixed reception, with people disappointed that Hitchcock departed from his usual romantic-thriller, and had veered off into mystery. So, with all of this in mind, and this film being a personal favorite of my friend, a Hitchcock aficionado, let's dive right into a film that changed Hitchcock's career forever! Vertigo follows an former detective with a fear of heights who is enlisted by an old college friend to follow his wife, because the man fears his wife may be suicidal. As the detective gets further and further into the dark mystery, he soon finds that he may be in love with the woman. I didn't know what to expect from this movie, honestly. Like I said, my one friend is a very big fan of the movie, and that's what propelled me to watch it as one of the first Hitchcock films as part of my marathon. James Stewart and Kim Novak do stellar jobs as the two leads, bringing themselves as well as the audience into a whirlwind romance that is rather remarkable the more you think about it. Stewart, in particular, really sells the character that I believe Hitchcock was going for. Barbara Bel Geddes does a lovely job as Midge, and really sells the character of a girl just trying to help Scottie through what is happening. Tom Helmore does a great job in his somewhat limited role as Madeleine's husband, really selling the role he's supposed to play. The effects used in the movie, particularly the ones used to convey Scottie's fear of heights are quite remarkable given the time in which they were done. It truly feels like you can feel his fear and what he's going through, The music, done by longtime Hitchcock collabrator Bernard Herrmann, is quite impressive. Especially the music in the opening, it gets you curious and grabs your attention immediately so you begin asking what's going on. The set pieces, making great use of many locations around San Francisco, are fantastic. Special greetings are given to the church used in the middle-end of the film, which had a tower that was digitally superimposed upon the church, harking back to the effects comments I made. Another set I liked are both Midge and Scottie's apartments, the contrasts between Midge's bright colors and Scottie's more subdued ones are quite subtly done. Perhaps my one complaint with the film, and it's probably just trivial, but the scene where Scottie has a nightmare and it's all cartoonish and stuff, it seemed really fake and forced. I mean, it's still a cool sequence, but I feel like it didn't mesh well enough with the rest of the film. Overall, Vertigo is a superb film. It's acting, effects, music, set pieces, and script are all fantastic. While I have some issues with Scottie's nightmare sequence, the rest of the film is a cut above the rest and if you enjoy a good unconventional mystery, then you'll get a kick out of this film. 10/10. Grade: A",0.0

6537,"How such a right movie can become so wrong; When I first read that Terminator 3 was being developed in mid February 2002 I jumped off my chair and cheered loudly. I remember the anticipation for the movie being huge. I was watching trailers, following updates here and on other sites on a weekly basis up until the release of the film. So I entered the cinema, only to see that someone in production didn't share my opinion on what a Terminator film is all about. A Terminator movie to me is all about the frightening, unbelievable, yet realistic story about men creating it's own doom by making smarter and smarter computers and machines. It's about the story and adventures of Sarah Connor and John Connor. It's also about having the most hardcore villains ever in firstly Arnold Schwarzenegger and secondly Robert Patrick. In the same way that Keith Richards playing guitar in the third Pirates of the Caribbean movie the casting of a Terminatrix beating up Arnold Schwarzenegger sinks a landmine into the heart of the movie. Now, Kristanna Loken is a beautiful woman, and also good at what she's doing in this film. It's only that the role she's playing doesn't work for me. I know that her role is a superior model to Arnold's and I have to think deeper than this, but there is just no way that it looks right to me when a beautiful woman kicks Arnold Schwarzeneggers but. It's a totally wrong decision in my opinion. That was the saddest part of the movie to me. And while we're at it. There's about one or two jokes in some scenes in the first two movies that never ever makes the film cross the line to being a comedic film. At parts, this movie truly is comedic and even silly. It doesn't feel like it has the right tone for a Terminator movie. The casting of Nick Stahl as John Connor isn't a perfect choice either in my opinion... He's not that good of an actor and doesn't even look like Edward Furlong a few years into the future from Terminator 2. That's why I'm so glad they cast Christian Bale as Connor for the new Terminator Salvation film since he's a much better actor and looks way more like Furlong than Stahl does. Now to the good parts of the movie. Apart from the to me obvious flaws of the movie that I presented it does have glimpses of classic Terminator quality. The core story, Terminatrix aside, is actually good. The Directing is good. Claire Danes is brilliant as well as Arnold Schwarzenegger. Kristanna Loken is good at playing a Terminatrix, it's just that her role is hopeless to succeed in my opinion. So that's a really double-edged sword. I don't think there's any woman that could have done it any better. The music arrangements are good and feel like a Terminator movie and so are some of the action scenes.

Monsters, Inc. employees generate their city's power by targeting and scaring children, but they are themselves afraid that children may contaminate them. When one child, Boo, enters Monsters, Inc., Mike and Sulley must return her. Sulley and Mike overcome a lot of difficulties to return her. It is the highlight of the film.

5816,"The real first movie, in many ways; The Chamber Of Secrets is significantly better with each viewing. The film greatly improves upon the first installment's flaws, which those who read my first review will remember I said had too minor a focus on the main plot of the Stone and more focus on the world-building and exposition. This film's main narrative of the Chamber being opened again is much more present, Steven Klove finally finding a perfect balance between the bits of them interacting with the Wizarding World, and the bits of the main driving narrative. Not only is the main narrative strongly written with great dialogue and a real sense of unraveling to an ultimate moment and climax, but its actually far more interesting when you view it again after seeing the later films and know the hidden information of the good guys' and bad guys' secrets. All of the plot threads that will last through the series are brilliantly put in place here so subtly but without distracting from the central narrative, such as the real reason Snape is so hard on Harry and Ron's poverty and Voldemort's prejudice against Muggle-Borns and the secret to his survival, etc. Heck, even the word Expelliarmus isn't said until this movie! In a way, since the essential tropes and aesthetic for the whole series aren't put in place until this installment, this almost feels like the real first film! This film has aged very well, and I can honestly say that it gets miles better with each viewing. The secrets to this franchises' success have finally been opened!",0.0
3751,"Definitely NOT one of the Top 250 movies of all time...; After seeing Chicken Run, I can't fathom how people are naming this as one of the best movies they've ever seen.  I will give it credit for it's technical merits (innovative animation work and exceptional voice acting), but the rest of the movie was incredibly unoriginal.  As I watched the movie, I couldn't help but recall every family-oriented movie I've ever seen.  Now, having said that, before I saw the movie, I never once regarded it as a family movie, but after seeing the rehashed theme and uninspired love story, that's all I could think of it as.  There was only one line in the movie that made me laugh, with most of the other jokes being bad puns and unfunny references.  I'd say go see this if you're REALLY bored and have seen everything else out there...",0.875
527,"Powerful Film!; ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire."" 'Schindler's list is about the true story of Czech born Oskar Schindler, a businessman who tried to make his fortune during the Second World War by exploiting cheap Jewish labour, but ended up penniless having saved over 1000 Polish Jews from almost certain death during the holocaust.' Steven Spielberg's best film, by far! His camera work in the film is unique.40% of this film is used with a hand-held camera. There were no steadicams or crane shots used. His efforts were to make it look more like a documentary and his effects were great! The black and white effect used only adds to the depression. The editing of colour throughout is very powerful, examples include the candles burning, the girl in the red coat and the ending sequence. The acting presented is amazing. Liam Neeson brings an Academy Award worthy performance to the screen. His transition from a greedy business man to humanitarian is marvellous. Ralph Fiennes is also great in the film. He plays Amon Goeth, an SS officer who is sadistic and psychopathic, frequently murdering his prisoners for fun. A performance not many can accomplish. Ben Kingsley is amazing portraying Itzhak Stern. He makes my favourite scene. As Stern figures out that Schindler is using his own money to rescue Jews, his face expression says it all. Very emotional. The Score in this film is magic. In my opinion, it's the music that brings out the most of the emotion in the film. John Williams is brilliant! Schindler's List will not only go down as the best holocaust film ever made but one of the best films in the history of cinema.",0.0
4326,"""When America was at war with itself..."" - a gripping & engaging experience !!; One year after his misunderstood masterpiece, ""Angel Heart"", the English director Alan Parker returns to the South for filming ""Mississippi Burning"", a crime / thriller drama about 2 F.B.I. agents sent to Jessup County, Mississippi in 1964 to investigate the disappearance of 3 civil rights activists. Led by the younger agent, Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe), a yankee 'crusader' and a symbol of Kennedy's administration, who follow the Bureau's rules by the book & his older and savvy partner, Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman), a former Mississippi Sheriff, who knows the behavior, mentality, traditions & way of life of his fellow countrymen. When they suspect that the Ku Klux Klan may be operating there and responsible for the disappearance of the 3 activists with the support of the local law, Ward & Anderson start a war against the ""phantom' killers in searching for the truth, clashing with the town people that don't want them there... Superbly directed motion picture from an engaging screenplay penned by Chris Gerolmo, based on actual facts and visually stunning, shot by the cinematographer Peter Biziou, who won a well deserved Academy Award, ""Mississippi Burning"" is a gritty, realistic & sweaty movie experience, filmed on location near where the actual murders took place with even some scenes shot in a documentary style which enhanced the straight tone of the film. It moves at a thrilling pace, involving the viewer in the sordid ways of racism at his worst, stereotyping that (almost) all of the white southern characters are evil and preaches the audience about the innocent victims of the intolerance and the deserved punishment of their executioners, guided by the eyes of two different lawmen, the liberal moralist - Willem Dafoe and the conservative 'vigilante' , Gene Hackman. Hackman delivers maybe his best performance since his brilliant turn in Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Conversation"" ('74), he's determined, reckless & sarcastic, showy, but commanding the screen with gravitas proving why he's one of the best (still sadly, underrated) north American actors ever. Willem Dafoe, fresh from his Academy Award nomination for ""Platoon"", co-stars in a less prominent role, but equal effective, especially in his ""boy scout"" antagonism with the Hackman character. Frances McDormand, who scored a nomination for Best Supporting Actress, is the stand-out / revelation as the disgruntled & fragile wife of the local Deputy. She shines in a role that could have been underplayed if performed by a less capable actress. The supporting players are top notch (kudos to the casting department & Parker's skillful direction of actors) from the always remarkable as the hateful 'usual suspects"": Brad Dourif & Michael Rooker to R. Lee Ermey; Gailard Sartain; Badja Djola in an intense cameo appearance; Tobin Bell, making here his feature film debut, years before his breakthrough role in the ""Saw"" franchise and Stephen Tobolowsky, among others. In short, ""Mississippi Burning"" was one of the best films of 1988, nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director & Best Leading Actor for Hackman, winning 1 and perhaps only lost the Best Picture Oscar, due to the Academy's emotional vote in favor of Barry Levinson's sympathetic drama, ""Rain Man"". Highly recommended !!",0.0

There were stupid jokes that were offensive to so many people. If you are a woman, this is offensive to you. It's offensive to Jewish people as well. It was truly that bad. Don't see it.

8874,"Shawn of a decent script; As with nearly all British movies this effort falls well short of Hollywood standards. A first-time script shows itself up to being rather an amatuerish attempt. Brit movies are mostly created by people who have come fresh from TV without bothering to understand the medium. Lame, quirky sit-com style dialogue dominates the first act. There's a confusion as to what the writers are trying to achieve with some vague notions about character set-up and development. However, I was prepared to forgive the weak opening, after the 2nd act started well with two very funny moments. Everything seemed to be coming right and I was sitting back ready for a good hour's laughter. Unfortunately, me and the rest of the audience were to be dissapointed. The comedy dried up pretty soon, with us realising we were at a one-gag event where the writers had no idea where to go with this story. The script fell into a muddle - is this sitcom? Farce? Romantic comedy? Horror? Drama? Barely a snigger was to be had from the entire second half of the movie. At one point, our heros are beating a zombie to 'death' in time to a Queen track being played on the duke box. Maybe this got huge laughs in other showings, but in my theatre there was a deathly silence as this scene went on and on... and on. A moment later I noticed people leaving. The end is pretty bad. The writers just seem to have forgotten this is meant to be a comedy. Perhaps Simon Pegg decided to write himself some emotional scenes to look good on his showreel. Waste of time - he really ain't that good an actor. All in all, this movie was a failure. The fact it was located in Crouch End (where I grew up but is now inhabited by the media 'elite') didn't endear it to me either. They tried to make out Crouch End is full of 'normal' people (the place is full of people who think they're great movie makers but are really just average TV makers). Now, if those Crouch End zombies had been the BBC/Channel 4 TV producers, media lawyers, wanna be script writers, graphic designers, pseudo-intellectuals... now there's a zombie flick I wanna see.

1080,"And now for something completely...lame, boring, unimaginative.; I don't pretend to have a sixth sense but the truth is, I can sometimes detect the sophomoric and the inane just by the names. That's what has always happened to me with Monty Python, words which simple mention evoke images of shallow, irrelevant material. And that's what LOB is all about. A movie that got everything to convince you to keep a wide berth with anything associated with that outfit. As a reviewer put it well, these are guys who never grew up from the pranks they played in their dorms when in college, just because nobody told them they weren't funny anymore. Nobody told them that putting a guy in drags wasn't enough to get people rolling on the floor, despite what you can see in those hideously overrated M.A.S.H. movie & TV series. Nobody told them that the words Biggus Dickus will only elicit laughs in geeks who still at their forties live with their moms and who never went to a prom because they couldn't even get their own sister to go with them; that just making some character say someone else is weird doesn't mean he is, that most probably he's just lame--like the guy who insists that a crucifixion isn't such a bad thing after all because...""you get some fresh air there"". So, if you are not already chocking with guffaws forget about this tripe and go do something more rewarding, such as setting your car on fire for ex.. Oh, this is about a guy who's born at the same time as Jesus Christ, but next door, from an annoying woman--a real man playing the part. Then his life takes a parallel course to that of the Messiah, but in supposedly funny ways, all the way to his own crucifixion--that because some other condemned men took his place when he, Brian, was pardoned. The clunker tumbles along in a purely episodic way, from sketch to sketch, without definite structure, direction, as no effort is made to keep an adequate plot development, trusting that the jokes will be funny enough to carry the thing forward. Those supposedly hilarious goofs include a gladiator who has a heart attack in the arena; a group of conspirators hiding from a group of Roman soldiers searching a house, by covering themselves with mantels, crouching on the floor, and the soldiers not finding anyone--oh, wait; give me a minute or so while I pick myself from the floor. Oh, and a leper who was cured by Jesus but who's P.O. now because he doesn't get any alms money anymore. I'm not making it up. The basic idea behind the plot is one of those which have been forever floating around and about which people write stories, make movies. Like that of the guy who lives some adventure only to wake up and realize it was only a dream; or the man/woman whose life alternates between dream states and awakened ones, to realize at the end the dreams were the reality after all and the perceived reality just a dream. Here is about a guy who becomes an unwilling Messiah. I wrote a story about the same topic, at that time by coincidence, and there was nothing gratuitous about it, as it was the way I reacted to the horrendous news coming from Guyana about the mass suicide, or murder, of almost a thousand followers of cult leader Jim Jones, who died also in that tragedy. The point I tried to make there is the same Brian makes when addressing the crowd--in the only scene worth to be watched--that people should stop looking for salvation elsewhere than in themselves, because the most probable outcome will be that they'll fall in the hands of some self-serving charlatan who will only used them for his own benefit. Now, had LOB been structured around such an idea, that could have probably made for a better and more intelligent film, but it is obvious that Monty Python was going here for the easy laughs, so the claim that they intended to do something deeper, more serious than a simple series of sophomoric sketches, rings rather hollow. In all, basically a good idea; one that could have worked well, even as a comedy, in the hands of people really giving serious thought to it. 1/10.",0.0
6773,"Animated Relaxation on a Stick; Whilst the paper-thin plot may annoy some viewers, the crunchy amphibians may revolt others (you'll see..), this film shines in its simplicity. It doesn't TRY to be deep (there may be hidden meanings wrapped around umpteen parts of the film, there may not, frankly I'm always too busy enjoying it to care), it just entertains and strips away the office-induced headaches and stress. It's good to know that there's something heart-warming, attention-grabbing and homely in a film, yet it demands so little from you. You just fire it up, lay back and melt into the couch. Other aspects of the film have been probed to death by scores of other reviewers. So, I'll leave it at this: try it if you want something different, it really doesn't demand you think differently, just be in the mood to relax.

527,"Wow; Steven Spielberg has made his own Holocaust museum. In Schindler's List (Universal), an adaptation by Steven Zaillian of Thomas Keneally's book, Spielberg has created a 184-minute account of the fate of Kraków's Jews under the German occupation, centered on the German businessman and bon vivant, Oskar Schindler, who devised a ruse to save 1,100 Jews from the Auschwitz ovens. A closing note tells us that in Poland today there are fewer than 4,000 Jews but in the world there are 6,000 ""Schindler Jews,"" survivors and descendants. For this film Spielberg has done the best directing of his career. Much of his previous work has been clever and some of it better than that, but Schindler's List is masterly. He has, with appropriate restraint, shot it in black and white (except for two closing sequences in color). Janusz Kaminski's superb cinematography uses shadows like prosody illuminates with shadows. Michael Kahn has edited with intensity and line, never breathless, always fast. (One demurral: the inter cutting between a Jewish wedding in a camp, a wild German officers' party and a German officer's boudoir romp is heavy.) John Williams has arranged a score, with Itzhak Perlman doing violin solos, that for the most part is quiet: Jewish melodies on woodwinds or a small children's chorus under scenes of inhumanity.

Harry Potter(Daniel Radcliffe)is now attending his second year at Hogwarts and he is eager to start. But his troubles soon start when Doody The House Elf(Toby Jones)pays him a little visit. Soon Harry, Ron Weasley(Rupert Grint), and Hermonie Granger(Emma Watson)are on an adventure of a lifetime when they find out that The Chamber Of Secrets has been opened. But by whom they don't know. They believe it to be Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton). But maybe they are wrong. Maybe it's Harrys new friend Tom Riddle(Christian Coulson) Now they must act fast. They must run to the rescue of both Hogwarts and the students of Hogwarts. But in their path is the professor that doesn't know a thing about magic except a magic spell that makes you forget. I loved the way Dobby, Lucius Malfoy and Draco were portrayed. More than less these are my favorite actors of the Harry Potter series. Alan Rickman(Professor Snape)is a close crush for myself. So is Warwick Davis(Professor Flintwick). It's too bad that one actor doesn't have more screen time. He'd be a great star in this series.

1246,"A well done film about coming of age; ""Dead Poets Society"" is a movie that is enjoyable with just good acting and competent filmmakers at the helm. John Keating arrives at Welton Academy in 1959, years after attending the school, as the new English teacher. He wastes no time making an impact on his students, saying ""Carpe Diem,"" or ""Seize the day"" to them. The pupils at first do not know what to make of Keating, who is not the usual Welton teacher. After coming across a yearbook, a group of his students find out that Keating belonged to a club called the Dead Poets Society. Seeking answers, they confront Keating, and he reluctantly tells them about going to a cave not far from the school, and he and his fellow members recited and created poetry. Intrigued by what he heard, Neil Perry, the leader of the group, organizes a revival of the Dead Poets Society, and everyone agrees to attend. Later on, Neil finds an old poetry book on his desk. Upon opening it, he finds that it is Keating's copy of the book that was used at each meeting. The gang goes to the cave and spends the night there, immersed in poetry. Keating has an impact on the boys in more ways than one. He tells them they are going to think for themselves, and to find their own voice. Several of the boys take that to heart. Meanwhile, Mr Nolan, the Academy's headmaster, has received word about Keating's teaching style. He approaches Keating about this, and wanting to put a stop to Keating's maverick methods, tells him to just prepare them for college and leave it at that. However, Nolan is already too late, for several of Keating's students have already decided to see what life is all about. ""Dead Poets Society"" features a talented ensemble cast. Robin Williams is great as Keating, in one of his best dramatic performances. Robert Sean Leonard (known to TV viewers as Wilson on House) are both good as Neil and Todd. And Kurtwood Smith, best known as Red Forman on ""That 70s Show,"" is well cast as Neil's stern and demanding father. The film is a story of a dedicated teacher, but it is also a coming of age tale. In addition, it is a study of conformity vs. non-conformity. It would have been interesting to see how the lives of the characters turned out during the 1960s, when the counterculture first came about. This is a movie that you should watch. Don't miss it.",0.0

903,"The Obsessive Power of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo; Synopsis: A retired detective (James Stewart) with vertigo spies on and becomes obsessed with an old acquaintance's wife (Kim Novak) whom the husband feels is possessed by one of her dead relatives. Review: Vertigo was a personal project for director Alfred Hitchcock; arguably his most personal work. Vertigo is more than a brilliant suspense film; at its heart it is a story about obsession and the struggle to let go. James Stewart gives one of the great performances in the history of cinema with his dark portrayal of Scottie, an obsessed detective with a fear of heights. Kim Novak is also excellent as Madeleine, the woman at the center of Scottie's obsession. Hitchcock, with his pristine craft, utilizes his directorial abilities by using camera-techniques, fog filters, beautiful and rich colors, mirrors, and Bernard Herrmann's haunting musical score to help the audience journey into the mind of Scottie as well as to accentuate Scottie's journey into the depths of his obsession. Vertigo is one of the greatest films ever made and it is the ultimate testament to Hitchcock's brilliance.",0.0
1246,"Truly Moving and Inspiring; If someone has not been deeply moved and inspired by such a wonderful film as ""Dead Poets Society"", I really don't know what can do the trick for him/her... ""DPS"" was the nice surprise of the late 80s: Appeared out of nowhere (no big-time promotion, smallish budget, not-very-well-known actors at that time apart from Robin Williams) and instantly stole the hearts and minds of virtually everybody who watched it. Within a short while, ""carpe diem"" and ""oh captain, my captain"" became familiar and beloved phrases. Moreover, the film became a legend for its spirit of free-thinking and its message of ""seizing the day"" and managing one's destiny. ""DPS"" is about a newly-arrived teacher Mr. Keating (Williams) into Welton, a traditional, respected, and rigid school in the late 50s. Not only is Mr. Keating himself a graduate from ""Hell-ton"", but he is also carrying with him a free-thinking and innovative style which is utterly incompatible with the ways the Welton pupils had been used to. The professor transmits his magic to his pupils, including among others Todd Anderson (Hawke), the shy brother of a famous Welton graduate, and his room-mate, Neil Perry (Leonard), a talented boy who is kept under the wings of an oppressive father. Mr. Keating's magic transforms his boys' beliefs and ideals, but unfortunately not all good things in life last forever... Williams is simply unforgettable as Mr. Keating, a role which for many people (including me) has been forever associated with him. What is even more striking, is the astonishing performance of all the young boys: From the then-unknown Ethan Hawke, to Gale Hansen as Charlie ""Nuwanda"" Dalton, and of course, to Robert Sean Leonard as Mr. Keaton's star pupil, Neil Perry. This is a movie everyone should watch: It may have no dazzling shoot-outs and special effects, star actors and sexy actresses, and all the other usual Hollywood block-buster elements, but it is one of those films that you never forget. 10/10.",0.0

The job is simply to tail his wife because she's obsessed with an ancestress who committed suicide, and the wife, Madeline, is showing signs of herself being suicidal. Ferguson tails her diligently and as the tail progresses, Ferguson himself starts to become ever obsessed about the demur blonde Madeline. As the story twists and turns, Ferguson's obsession will have far reaching consequences for both parties... Vertigo is Alfred Hitchcock's most discussed, dissected and critically reappraised film, based on a novel by Pierre Boileau called D'Entre Les Morts, (also writer of Diabolique), Vertigo was not well liked on its release and unable to be viewed for some time due to copyright, the film was restored from a destroyed negative into a glorious 70mm print, and now in all its glory it can be seen as one of the greatest films to have ever been made. What is most striking about Vertigo, outside of Hitchcock baring his innermost that is, is that its plot on the surface is simplicity personified, but delving deeper, and repeat viewings are a necessity, its apparent that Vertigo is a chilling force of cinema, taking great delight in gnawing away at your perceptions, perhaps even your own capabilities as a human being. Very much a film of two great halves, Vertigo first seems intent on being an almost ghost story like mystery. Once the prologue has introduced us to Ferguson's fear of heights, we then enter an almost dream like sequence of events as Ferguson tails the troubled Madeline, the suggestion of reincarnation bleakly leading to death hangs heavy as Hitchcock pulls his atmospheric strings. Then the film shifts into dark territory as obsessions and nods to Dante's Inferno and feverish dreams take control, Hitchcock, as we have come to learn over the years, lays out his soul for us the audience to partake in, the uneasy traits sitting side by side with fascination of the story. All of which is leading us to a spine tingling finale that is as hauntingly memorable as it is shocking, the end to our own dizzying journey that Alfred and his team have taken us on. Technically the film is magnificent, the opening credits from Saul Bass brilliantly prep us for what is about to unfold, while Bernard Herrmann's score is as good as anything he ever did, unnerving one minute, swirlingly romantic the next, a truly incredible score. Hitchcock himself is firing from the top draw, introducing us to the brilliant zoom-forward-track-back camera technique to induce the feeling of Vertigo itself, with that merely a component of two hours of gorgeous texture lined with disturbing little peccadilloes. The two leads are arguably doing their respective career best work, James Stewart as Scottie Ferguson goes real deep to play it out with an edgy believability that decries his aw-shucks trademark of years since past. Kim Novak as Madeline is perhaps the quintessential Hitchcock blonde, perfect with the duality aspects of the role and playing off Stewart's ever creepy descent with seamlessly adroit skill. It however should be noted that Hitchcock and his loyal subjects had to work hard to get Novak right for the role, but the result proves that Novak had ability that sadly wasn't harnessed on too many other occasions. Vertigo is a film that I myself wasn't too taken with on my first viewing, it's only during revisits that the piece has come to grab me by the soul and refuse to let go, it not only holds up on revisits, it also gets better with each subsequent viewing, it is simply a film that demands to be seen as many times as possible. Not only one of the greatest American films ever made, one of the greatest films ever made...period, so invest your soul in it, just the way that Hitchcock himself so clearly did. 10/10",0.0
4388,"Funnier Then The Original!; Now don't get me wrong, I think that SCARY MOVIE is definitely one of the funniest movies ever made, but SCARY MOVIE 2 is even funnier! It is without a doubt in my top best comedy movies. The Wayans brothers always make the most hilarious films. Shorty, Cindy, Ray, and Brenda all join together again with some new people to go and spend the night in a haunted mansion, where ghosts, goblins, and men in wheelchairs are creeping around all over the place. I would now like to say that the chick who plays Theo is SO HOT! Even if this movie were not so hilarious, it would still be worth watching it just to see her walking around half naked.

4886,"Movie-Filled Fun Anyone?; May have possible spoilers!!!  Read at your own risk!!! With Pixar/Disney's success with their earlier computer-animated features (Toy Story, Toy Story 2, A Bugs Life) I expected them to continue their formal relationship with creating another exceptional movie.  They did not disappoint me. They put together some great characters and some great voice talents to go with them.  James `Sully' Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman) and his friend/partner Mike Wozowski (voiced by Billy Crystal) work at Monsters, Inc., a factory that produces the energy for Monstropolis by capturing the screams of children as their employers go into their closets and pop out.  They say that children are scared of monsters that hide in the closet, but its getting harder to scare children with all of the TV shows they watch.  To prevent rolling blackouts' (remember California?), they must get as many screams as possible.  Mr. Waternoose, the CEO of Monsters, Inc. holds a contest to see which monster can produce the most screams from children, which they lock in yellow containers. Sully is currently the best monster at frightening children in the whole company.  Second in line behind Sully is Randall, who would do anything, even cheat, to get to the top.  The one lone thing that must not happen is human children must not touch the monsters or they will die (or so they think).  Heck, the CDA (Children Detection Agency) of Monstropolis goes berserk when one of the company workers return from a room with a girl's sock on his back; they end up clean-shaving all of the fur from his body.  Maybe they are just a little too uptight there. Sully gets into hot water when he accidentally lets a little girl (he eventually nicknames Boo) into the factory via her `door' (the door that leads to her closet).  Sully and Mike try everything possible to get Boo back into her own room, though it turns out to be much more difficult than expected.  They discover that the human girl poses them no threat, since she is only about five years old and is totally helpless.  I don't want to say too much about the movie, since I would rather let the watcher be surprised. Easily a ten out of ten for my rating.  I'm sure they could do a great sequel given the opportunity.

1175,"Horror both strange and beautiful.; Delicatessen captures the essence of (good!) art-house flicks through its exploration of human character matched with unique visual style. Sometime in the future (after some unspecified disaster has occurred) people struggle to survive using arcane technology and changed morals. The mail is delivered by bicycle, television is in black and white, and food is scarce. So scarce, that responding to a job wanted ad could be your demise, and a healthy meal for others. Against this backdrop, the two main characters (Louison and Julie) struggle to find love and happiness. The other tenants of their apartment building add to the story, each with their own personality traits. I watched Delicatessen on VHS subtitled in English. I would definitely watch this again. Similar to Brazil in its artistic scope, but without the nonlinearities.",0.0

71057,"When dolls rule the world; 9 is like The Matrix meets Toy Story. The world is now overrun by machines and mankind has only one hope: a rag doll. The doll is named 9, voiced by Elijah Wood, and he holds the key to destroying the machines, only he doesn't know it. He ventures out into the world and finds the other dolls lead by 1, voiced by Christopher Plummer, one of the only good voice acting performances in the film. What ensues is an adventure through the post apocalyptic streets and buildings to find answers, destroy the machines, and ultimately survive. It's full of creative contraptions and very detailed settings, but all together the film just didn't appeal to me. Something about knowing that mankind fails in trying to overcome the machines was an immediate turnoff. We must now forget about ourselves and focus on what these rag dolls can do. It's almost too unbelievable for this story to happen. We are never really given a timeline for this, but some of the technology looks pretty intense while other parts are somewhat old fashioned. It's like looking at the future from a previous decade. Another thing about the story is the overused ""man vs. machine"" war. Granted nothing like this story has ever been put to screen before, there are a lot of similarities to other stories of this nature. The production as a whole was fairly decent. The animation was very good and the camera work was of the same quality. The settings were realistic enough and the atmosphere was right. The characters fear was almost palpable at times.The voice acting left something to be desired. The cast included Wood, Plummer, John C. Riley, Jennifer Connelly, Martin Landau, and Crispin Glover. They were effective in certain scenes and the opposite in the next. The voices didn't seem quite right depending on the situation or the mood. Overall it's a fair attempt at an animated feature. For director Shane Acker, it's a good first feature. It's based off of his Oscar nominated short of the same name, an impressive short film. I have seen much worse from the animated feature department. This runs somewhere in the middle. It's a cute movie with a dark side that kids might be scared of but young adults could enjoy.",0.0
1080,"Monty Python and the Search for Religion; The British comedy troupe Monty Python had always been on the edge of controversy ever since their show ""Flying Circus"" appeared on the BBC in the late 1960s, but nothing had prepared the world for what Life of Brian had brought. In Life of Brian, the comedians go after the one institution that has always had trouble accepting satire: religion, specifically the Christian Church. Seen as blasphemous, Life of Brian needed an eleventh hour rescue for Beatle George Harrison to finish the film. The church was wise to wonder what the Pythons were doing. Life of Brian is filled with questions of the role of religion in society, why people often feel they need religion, and the age old question of ""What would happen if the 3 wise men went to the wrong stable on that night they brought gifts to the young savior?"" There is typical Python silliness throughout the movie, set up early where listeners at one of Jesus' sermons (held at ""tea time,"" of course) think they hear that ""blessed are the cheese makers."" But the most important part of this film, and it's charm, are the questions of religion. No matter your faith, you will find scenes in Life of Brian unsettling, provocative, and humorous, possibly all three at once. While not wall-to-wall as funny as Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Life of Brian is a humorous look at civilization's oldest and dearest institutions, and asks us to consider what we are doing.",0.0
1246,"There are extremely memorable lessons you can find in this movie; The dead poet's society is such an outstanding drama that can change ones' perspective on their life. Set in high school time, there is a genius teacher that is eager to make his students' life extraordinary. Believing that everyone has their own success, he strove for bringing out the best in their students with anything he can do, such as explaining the things in a way that can make students understand the most. There are some important lessons from this drama. One of them, which most of the people took the lesson of, is Carpe Diem, which basically means seize the day. However, there's a more valuable thing that I think people are likely to overlook it, and that is to always look at something in a different way which is illustrated by the teacher standing on his desk. This is very constructive because when we only look at something in a particular way and don't try to observe in other way, we can't have full picture of that thing. It is like if we only see an elephant from front view for the whole of our life, we never know that elephant is big until we die. In conclusion, I strongly recommend that you watch this movie and get many memorable lesson from it.",0.0

""Scary Movie 2"" is such a case. The original, released July 7, 2000, was a surprise and made $40 million opening weekend. While it spoofed the teenage slasher genre quite diligently, I felt the lowbrow levels of humor went wayward and failed. To my avail, ""Scary Movie 2"" was nearly bathed in lowbrow from head to toe, but the experience this time was more enthralling. In closing, if in the case you cannot ingest the film after the first ten minutes, then leave the theater and ask for a refund.

66097,"Selick is right up there with Burton!; Coraline/2009/***1/2 Main Stars: Coraline: Dakota Fanning Mother/Other Mother: Teri Hatcher Wybie: Robert Bailey Jr. They don't make movies like Coraline very often but perhaps that's a good thing. Why? It's simple. If shown too often, stop motion animation would lose its novelty. Only fourteen years ago the spectacle that was Toy Story was released and it received tons of attention and rave reviews not just for its very witty screenplay but also for its rare look. Not one film had looked like that and had a FEATURE LENGTH running time to it until Toy Story was released in 1995 by Pixar. Yes, Pixar had released fully and digitally animated films but they were all within the duration of ten minutes or less. But now what do we see AT LEAST 5-10 times a year? An animated film. I'm not saying this is bad. It's alright if it's digitally animated by computer as long as the screenplay is very good. Pixar has absolutely no problem with clever screenplays in their animated films. Wall-E was sheer brilliance as was Ratatouille the year before. But I'm still partial to Toy Story more than any other film Pixar released. DreamWorks, however, might need to work a little on those screenplays, excluding their best work, Shrek. Coraline is based on the graphic novel by Neil Gaiman about a bratty little girl named Coraline (Dakota Fanning) that finds a secret door in the family room/living room of her house that leads into another version or rather alternate version of her life. This alternate version you will find is quite different from her real life. Completely the opposite, in fact. It reminded me so much of the joyous atmosphere of the dead in Tim Burton's Corpse Bride and the completely dull life of the living. What an ingenious contrast. Coraline is ingenious in itself as well but in a different way. Not only is the animation astounding, the screenplay decent, the originality brilliant, but there is a moral as well. One that's not too hard to find out but also one that is pretty important to keep in mind. The story is different and this moral has been used before. Coraline is a pessimist, always finding something to complain about; whether it's her life or the situation she's in. Nothing seems to be going her way. Even the boy living nearby, Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.), annoys her. But, she's curious and adventurous and gets her nose into every little thing. As she's browsing around the house to pass the time she notices a door. It has to lead somewhere. She manages to unlock it after a bitter argument with her mother but nothing's there. This doesn't stop her. Finally, following some mice, she enters this portal if you will. It reminded me of an air duct. She passes through it and arrives in the same house! Only this one is brighter, more colorful, smells of delicious food and features buttons for eyes. Her parents are much more cheerful. In the other world her mother (Teri Hatcher) is boring and so is her father (John Hodgman). The other mother and other father, however (played by the same people), are completely exuberant, almost forcing their smiles. The ringleader you could say is the other mother. There's also other Wybie and all the other neighbors in cheerful versions and if they're not, this is to be fixed. Coraline loves it! At first. But she is pessimistic and pretty cynical and if something doesn't go her way or someone wants her to do something she doesn't want to do, she'll get ticked off. It's all a gradual process in the other world, kind of making her be like everyone else. Does she follow suit? The whole button metaphor, or, at least the way I interpreted it, plays a major part in the story and is total genius as is the film as a whole. Like many Tim Burton films, this one has so much originality, vision and quirky characters, it comes to be one of the most entertaining stop motion films I've seen. Movie written for the screen and directed by Henry Selick.",0.0
38038,"It was always going to happen one day; STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Some years after their last TV outing, Wallace & Gromit, everyone's favourite plasticine heroes, are now running their own pest control business. Together, they must battle living threats to farmers crops, mainly in the shape of pesky rabbits, using Wallace's various contraptions. One such invention he's just developed is a mind-control machine that will rid rabbits of the desire to do bad things (namely eat crops.) But it all goes drastically wrong, and when the town comes under attack from the Were-Rabbit, the mother of all rabbits, it becomes clear that something very dubious is at work. Five years ago, with my Chicken Run review, I said it would have 'been better if they'd made a Wallace & Gromit film instead.' And, five years later, it looks as though that wish has come true with this effort that's popped up pretty much out of nowhere. Although there weren't that many W/G TV shorts, they were popular enough so that someone was bound to make a feature film of them one day. And that day has finally arrived. But unfortunately, here is one of those occasions where what worked as a TV show hasn't translated that brilliantly to a feature film. Although adequately enough. It's a fairly charming film, even a little funny in parts, with the familiar plasticine two-some back to their Yorkshire roots, as well as a neat supporting cast in the shape of Ralph Fiennes as the villain, Peter Kay (!) as a traditional Yorkshire PC and Helena Bonham Carter as a seductive posh bird, providing a love interest for Wallace that threatens to spoil the bond between man and dog. But stretching out as a feature film, it just doesn't quite have the same impact as the marvellous TV shorts did all those years ago. For something that was bound to happen, though, a pretty good effort and something of a welcome change from all the violence and vile language used to entertain in recent British films. ***",1.0
50005,"Help! I'm going Blind.; The first thing in the Curse of the Golden Flower you will noticed is the colors of this over-cooked film. This movie has the color palette of an exploding paint factory and overly loud like a pink fluorescent shirt. This movie is about a Chinese Imperial family a thousand years ago that wants to play like a Shakespearean tragedy but ends up confused the heck out me. You have the emperor, his younger new empress, his three sons. Mixed them all up and add a dash of poison for a good measure and you got a whole lot of blood letting in the end. I can not make head or tail of this movie not until after I have read the plot summary on IMDb. It seems that the emperor is having second thoughts about his new younger wife and decided to pull a Henry VIII without the whole beheading thing. His new younger wife by-the-way got the hots for her oldest step-son, while her second oldest sons happens to be her son with the emperor. I have no idea who the third sons belongs to. Anyway, the empress discovered the poison plot and decided it's time for a management change at the top, while her oldest step-son is chasing the daughter of the imperial family's doctor, which the emperor wants to have the good doctor and his family doing the dirt naps. Things really got interesting when the youngest son decided to jump into the foray. The color palette of this movie is not the only thing I have problem with this film. The costumes in the movie seems like somebody mixed up the woman's Chinese imperial costumes with the woman's Europen royal costumes of the 15th century. I have never seen so much cleavages in a Chinese film! Another thing you get to see is lots and lots of hallway tracking shots, long hallway tracking shots with color splashed everywhere by a person with a bad case of ADD. One more thing, the film-maker likes to show lots and lots of people in his movie. You have scenes of thousands of imperial soldiers running around for which you don't know where and how they came from. During the movie I have no ideas of who are the bad guys or who are the good guys, and frankly, I don't care, because in this film it's hard to root for the emperor, empress, or the princes or anybody. This is the kind of film that reaches across the border of China and over the vast Pacific Ocean and grabs you and makes you say, ""holy crap, this is an awful movie!"".",0.0

6773,"just let go and enjoy the ride.... Please.; Too many persons are writing WAYYYYYY too much into this beautifully executed French comedy - - - look first to the type of film and THEN to the style of its execution.  This would be a tremendous and very FUNNY story in the hands of any worthy film craftsman, but by crafting this tale in a drawn environment it takes on an ephemeral and surreal quality that defies the passage of time on screen and off.  It is a reasonably complex tale at some levels that can be reduced to the raw simplicity of the images on the screen or dissected and extrapolated to be `Anti-U.S.' ??? or whatever. You will enjoy the film MUCH more if you simply let go of ANY preconceptions about what you are going to view and let the story and imagery wash over you.  This is a film that cleans the artistic third eye and refreshes your ideas about the detail present on the screen as a reflection of the worth of the story.  If complexity of images was an ironclad guarantee of story quality then the Massive software alone should be enough to guarantee the little gold statues - fortunately this is not the case.  This is a deceptively simple story although I would recommend avoiding synopsis before viewing on paper that takes flight through the images and score and the sheer surprising nature of the images placed before you.  In the same fashion that `Delicatessen' is about; 'a butcher who is slowly eating the tenants in his building', that does not begin to tell you about the film and only viewing that work will impress upon you the urgency and poignant nature of the film.  Triplets is a movie you will not soon forget and should catch yourself laughing out loud in sheer delight in both the images and the ideas.  Too bad that these sort of films are often either dismissed or unfairly categorized often by people who couldn't even name a non-Disney animated feature or tell you who Rene Laloux was.. Sad..  I will see it at least once more on the large screen and be there the day the DVD goes on sale.  Highly Reccomended & Safe for Older Kidz.",0.027777777777777776
1175,"A sublime fusion of sickening grotesquerie and sentimental clowning.; Jeunet and Caro, with the help of their familiar repertory of actors, create a deeply disturbing and violent world where only a few shreds of conventional social mores remain. These scraps of morality only serve to delineate more clearly the overall decline and collapse of their dystopia. We see a butcher's shop; the proprietor, played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus, is evil almost to the point of caricature. He only manages to survive by killing his lodgers when they get behind with the rent and selling them as meat. However, the situation is given an added twist when we learn that all the lodgers are aware of this; a woman who is sold a joint of mother sheds a couple of stifled tears and mutters she would have liked to have said goodbye. Similarly, the butcher is most apologetic when he accidentally chops off the foot of one of his clients who has paid his rent in full. Into this hellish world is placed someone with his moral values relatively intact. In this case, it is a circus performer played by the marvellously rubber-faced Dominique Pinon. A less engaging actor might have made this character seem two-dimensional, as he appears to have no faults whatsoever (except a set of over-mobile lips). He enthrals the lodgers' children with his games, is immensely chivalrous to the butcher's daughter and plays the musical saw. Finally, an old edition of his act is broadcast on the flickering black-and-white television, and even the most bloodthirsty lodgers are amazed and delighted. The butcher's jealousy is roused; Good and Innocence is forced to fight Evil and Hatred. As such, the plot is relatively straightforward. It is the sheer surrealistic imagination that Jeunet and Caro bring to their films that prevent them being unremittingly bleak or simple morality tales. They display a brilliant sense of musical timing- the whole building frequently becomes an orchestra of creaking bed-springs, croaking frogs, and crackling radios; above all this soars a love-duet of a cello and a musical saw. The faded `look' of the film complements this. With the exception of a single television remote control, nothing here would be out of place in in a exhibition of 40s and 50s design. In `The City of Lost Children' the exuberance of the design threatens to swamp the slender storyline on occasions; here, the more `grown-up' themes and less fantastic design go hand in hand. (A word of warning about the video release- the subtitles appear to have been written be a couple of Frenchmen who really ought to have concentrated harder in their English classes at school. Apart from that, I wholeheartedly recommend this joyously grotesque film.)",0.0

71057,"""9"" - The world needs more animated movies like this!; At seeing the trailer for Shane Acker's new movie ""9"" on the internet..I was astounded. One of the most awesome trailers I'd ever seen. I knew instantly that I wanted to see the movie. About a week after it came out, I went to go see it. It wasn't quite what I was expecting. I'll break it down for you guys: Plot: 9 creations are made by a scientist when the world is almost at its end. The scientist dies, and the creations are all that remains on the earth..except for roaming mechanical monstrosities that serve a mysterious master. The plot was original. I don't care what anyone says. Yes, the post-apocalyptic theme has been done again and again, but never with little puppet-like protagonists. However, despite having a good concept, 9 has very quick pacing. So much so, that I was pretty surprised. There isn't very much build-up in the movie, mostly just hopping from scene to scene. Honestly though, this didn't bother or hinder the experience very much. The score: The music is quite good. Definitely inspired by Tim Burton, since he's one of the producers. The main theme is done by Danny Elfman, so of course it's good:) The animation: AMAZING! Visually, very appealing movie. In certain parts of the movie, the animation get's pretty darn close to Pixar quality. How does the movie make you feel?: 9 is a movie that tells of how people were too reliant on machines. It is also a movie about rebuilding. Like, what do you make out of a world that has nothing left in it? The theme definitely has a darker tone to it. Not really depressing, but just dark. Recommend: I seriously don't know what audience to recommend this movie to. Adults and teens are the target audience. But, please carefully research this movie if you have kids that scare easily and are planning to take them. Scare factor: There is a myriad of strange monsters in this movie. The main ones resemble a skeletal machine-like dog, a snake, and a flying bird with knives for a beak.When I lay it out like that..it doesn't sound very scary, but you need to seriously consider whether to show this movie to your kids or not. I actually don't think it would scare kids very much as long as they are at least 7 years old. This movie has dead bodies, character death, some creepy monsters, dark and dank scenery..just use discretion:). I've heard some people complaining about this movie. They say things like ""it's too short!"", ""the characters and story are boring!!"", ""it's confusing!"". Too short this movie is not. It's one hour, nineteen minutes. Average movie length is hour and a half. The characters are very simplistic and not much thought is given to developing their characters. However, you have to keep in mind that they are little burlap dolls. They have limited emotions. They don't act like people would because they aren't people. As far as ""boring"" goes, this movie just about had my eyes glued to the screen. It just depends on what kind of person you are, and what interests you. 9 is a little on the confusing side..most notably at the end of the movie. It's one of those movies that is supposed to make you think, that is why not everything is spelled out. 9 was originally a short film by Shane Acker when he was still in college. The original ""9"" was only about 10 minutes long. If this is considered, you can see why the plot appears to be rushed in the new version of the movie. That's how it originally was, after all. Overall: 9 is a movie with great computer graphics, good story, pleasant characters(almost refreshing with how simple they are), and some pretty cool action sequences. One of those particular scenes was practically genius. If your kid has a weird streak, they will probably enjoy this movie. Use discretion if your kids are really young or scare easily. 9 gets a decent 7/10 rating from me. Thanks for reading, and please go see the movie! The world needs more kick butt animated movies like this!",0.0
38038,"Entertaining all round!; Considering it took Aardman so long to get this film to the big screen, the anticipation mounted and pressure was on. I wasn't disappointed! This film is entertaining, fast-moving and visually stunning. I was laughing throughout and as the best animations usually do, there are more jokes for adults than kids! Watch out for all the wonderful little touches and movie references as well. Over all, W&G was fun with a great story, lovable and well-written characters and immaculate pacing. And my hero Gromit is the most expressive non-speaking character on the big screen! Much recommended, to fans and non-fans alike.",1.0
6493,"Clever and cute, not the greatest film ever, but worth it; I saw this film over the 4th of July weekend, looking forward to it, having not seen a really great chick flick in quite a while.  I took my mom and my younger sisters and we found Alex & Emma to be charming.  This film never set out to be anything life-changing or incredible, but succeeded (to the open-minded) in delivering a light-hearted romantic comedy. Luke Wilson, while a bit understated as a character, seemed to somehow show some quiet charm and charisma as Alex/Adam.  While slightly unbelievable as a GREAT author, he comes across very well as a romance novel author.  Kate Hudson continues to shine in whatever she's handed (even How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days or the abysmal The Four Feathers).  They could have played up her several characters a little more, but for the sake of time and plot movement, they continued on.  Sophie Marceau indeed was beautiful, and delivered a somewhat non-likable character (as was intended). My only gripe:  The prolonged sex scene was out of place and gratuitous.  This movie could easily have been rated PG.  Scarce profanity if any, and a pretty sweet love story (well, a couple of sweet love stories, actually).  Spare us the ridiculously uncalled for and even cartoony sex scenes, Hollywood!  What ever happened to the subtlety of implication?  Oh well. All in all, a good way to spend an evening.  See it for Kate Hudson, if for nothing else. 8/10",0.0
3751,"The ""Great Escape"" -- with chickens; That's how the creators of this film described it when pitching the idea to the production company. And there are some references to the classic movie, most of them in the first ten minutes or so. But they don't keep that up for the whole movie, fortunately.  For one thing, this is a much funnier movie.  And,even though you see Ginger in doing some stuff like Steve McQueen did in the original, she doesn't ride a motorcycle. The stakes are higher in this one, too.  The worst the prisoners in TGE could expect if they stuck around was really bad food.  But when Mrs. Tweedy found that there was more money to be made in chicken pot pies than eggs, Ginger knows that they have to get out. She's told that it's a million-to-one shot. ""Then we've still got a chance"", she replies. When Rocky the Rooster (Mel Gibson) drops in on them, Ginger feels that they have a chance.  If Rocky can just teach them to fly, they might have a chance. To reveal anymore would be spoiling the fun.  This is indeed ""fun for the whole family"", with funny characters and scenes from beginning to end.  My favorite characters were the two packrats, but the dim-witted chicken was a hoot as well. Two clucks up. Uncle Steve says check it out. And take the kids. ",0.875
19,"""this is a lovely room of death""; Maybe the greatest movie ever. The first scene in the movie where ace burps up some food for that little bird has been immitated by me many times (to the disgust of those around me who don't know what i'm doing, but to the delight of those who do know). ""Hungry little fella?"" lol The thing that makes this movie great, and the thing that makes all ridiculous movies great, is that you can watch it over and over again and suddenly find new things funny. When Ace walks up to the totem pole thing with the guy standing on top of it is one of these moments. Instead of raising up his head to look up (like a normal human) he instead bends his entire back and looks up at the pole,.. its ridiculous crap like this that makes this movie the greatest ever!

8838,"Hitting the road with Ellen and Marty; This early Scorcese film may find the director at this most conventional, (let's just say, it is one of his less personal projects), but it has a lot to recommend it nevertheless and it certainly doesn't disgrace the director's oeuvre. It's also almost a one-woman show; its central character, Alice, is hardly ever off the screen and Ellen Burstyn's tour-de-force rightly won her the Oscar as Best Actress. When the film opens she's a typical housewife caught in a stale marriage with a red-neck husband and the kind of 12 year old son you would happily see guillotined, (though when the film actually opens she's a little girl in Kansas in a wonderful pastiche of ""The Wizard of Oz"" before she and we are jettisoned into the present by Mott the Hoople and 'All the way from Memphis'). Alice's home life is beautifully observed in a series of short scenes with husband, son and neighbour before said husband is suddenly killed in a road traffic accident leaving Alice and sprog to fend for themselves. At this point the film turns into that staple so beloved of American movies in the seventies, the road-movie, as they set off in search of Alice's past and a career as a singer. Scorcese's observation of the dirty back-waters of the American West is beautifully done as indeed is his observations of the characters they meet en-route, (in particular a young Harvey Keitel as a charming sociopath and Diane Ladd as a foul-mouthed waitress as well as a marvellous early performance by a 13 year old Jodie Foster). For most of its length, (at least for the first two-thirds), the film could be described as something of a feminist comedy as Alice realizes the value of standing on her own two feet. Finally handsome cowpoke Kris Kristofferson saddles up and Alice is smitten. The singing career is, shall we say, put on hold. (Kristofferson isn't at all bad in this film; it's a likable, confident performance, maybe his best). For a director whose milieu is predominantly male, (and mostly violent), ""Alice ..."" marked and does mark a major departure. But what it has in spades is style and Scorcese's evident love of the whole movie-making process. In this respect it fits perfectly into the director's canon and should not be over-looked.",0.0
1080,"Comment on Python itself; This film certainlyhas the best narrative quality of any of the Python films and the writing, as always, is brilliant.  It is a very funny film in a dark satiric way.  All the Pythons, except for Terry Gilliam are very educated men (Oxford and Cambridge) and it shows in their writing. No one has mentioned and I think that it could be the case, that some of the satiric swipes in this film are directed at fans of Python themselves. Think about it, how people who like Python insist on repeating quotes and recite or sing along with Python.  The scene where Briantells the crowd to be individuals and the crowd repeats back in unison may be directed at their own fans urging them to get a life.",0.0
66097,The 3D does not work!!! Awful. Total Failure. Flickering Screen; I had to walk out of Coraline 3D after 5 minutes because of the awful flickering. It was like trying to watch a movie through a fan. 3D is dead before it started. Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D was so dark the 3D was barely noticeable. And Journey's 3D DVD was terribly produced. I returned my DVD and got a refund due to it's sloppy production. If John Cameron thinks Avatar is going to fly with this new 3D system I expect the biggest flop in show biz history. The old crappy red/green glasses worked better. Meet the Robinsons worked in 3D.

1148,"A comedic masterpiece; As a casual fan of cinema, I can say the world inhabited by Wallace (talkative sometimes inventor) and Gromit (his quiet, intellectual dog) is one of the most detailed and interesting committed to film.  Everything just fits together in such a way that you are transported to another world.  This attention to detail is only the first sign of the genius on display. The characters are quite lively and expressive.  Wallace and Gromit have large eyes and can convey a surprising amount of emotion using just their brows.  This is, in fact, the only way Gromit can emote since he can't talk.  He doesn't even bark, but never at any time are you left wondering what he's feeling.  An evil penguin plays an important role, and once again everything (music, setting, lighting) just comes together to let you know this is not a character to be trusted. What really makes this a gem of a film, however, is the comedy.  The chase scene at the end is one of the funniest things I have ever watched, and it's one of those things that I watch time and again and laugh at even knowing what the gag will be.  This easily ranks right up there with anything ever done by Jones or Disney as far as humor is concerned. The Wrong Trousers is probably the most well paced of the Wallace and Gromit trilogy, hence its place on the IMDB Top 250, but I highly recommend all three to anyone who wants a good laugh.  There's not a violent moment in sight, and so much of what makes the flim great is visual that children can watch and enjoy this great film with you.",1.0

3751,"Run to see this movie!; Chicken Run: The poultry population of Tweedy's farm has grown tired of being slaves to production and is determined to escape.  Unfortunately every attempt has either failed or been foiled.  They're given renewed hope with the arrival of Rocky, a swaggering American rooster who agrees to teach them how to fly in exchange for shelter. In a climate where computer animation has become the standard, it is refreshing to see what can be done with simple clay figures.  Produced by the team that created the Oscar winning ""Wallace and Gromit"" series, Chicken Run uses stop motion photography, a craft generally relegated to realm of animation festivals.  This is the first time this technique has been used in a full feature big budget movie and I was amazed at the versatility of the medium: the range of expressions and actions is amazing.  I can only imagine how much effort it took to create this picture but I'm glad they did. It is very difficult to try to categorize this movie as it s so different from the standard Hollywood fare.  For example, the marketing campaign has been brilliant - rather than simply showing trailers with snippets of the movie, they have crafted hilarious parodies of both MI:2 (people were screaming in delight when this trailer was shown before MI:2) and Gladiator. And unlike so many instances where the trailers are better than the movie, Chicken Run delivers. The story, which pays homage to such classic films as ""The Great Escape"", ""Stalag 17"" and ""Star Trek"", is well written, engaging and has elements that will appeal to both young and old alike.  The characters have more depth than many I've seen in live action films: whether you're drawn to Rocky, the cocky upstart with a secret, Ginger, the driven saviour of the group who yearns for freedom, or the crotchety old Colonel, you will find someone you can relate to.   The humor runs the gamut from subtle, to the absurd and it comes fast and furious  - the audience rarely stopped laughing.   Finally, the pacing is excellent - there are few lulls in the action and they don't rely on unnecessary filler to bridge the scenes. I don't know that this movie will be a blockbuster (read $200 million) but it is already on my top ten list for this year, and I think it will prove to be the ""Iron Giant"" for 2000.   If you're looking for a well-rounded family movie, look no further.",0.875

Having watched this for the first time in 2009, and being born after it was made makes this type of film a bit tricky to review, since it hinged on special effects. But I think they did a nice job with them. I was especially impressed with Medusa. There was not really anything that I really thought looked bad. The mechanical owl employes a bit of comedy to the film and will definitely remind you of R2- D2. It was also neat to see all kinds of mythological creatures come together for a film like this.

I wish more films like this were made, but studios get cold feet when they try to fund films like these which work with mocking religion.

38038,"""I never saw such cauliflower carnage!""; What I like about animated films is how film makers insert subtle adult humor that generally sail over kids' heads, the way the old Warner Brothers cartoons used to do with their characters. This one had Lady Totty showing off her melons to Wallace and the Pansy Spray used on Victor was another subtle but humorous touch. Otherwise I'm not what you'd consider an animated film fan, but I'll take one in every now and then, even if I'm way behind the curve by a decade or more like this one. It had it's humorous moments, with nods to other films scattered throughout; the King Kong reference was the most obvious one for this viewer. Even though the title implied a scary character, it didn't appear to be child unfriendly, and I'd say it was fairly entertaining for kids of all ages.",1.0

This dizzy French import borrows its mock portentous mood and visual momentum from the early films of Joel and Ethan Coen (by way of Terry Gilliam). But unlike a typical Coen brothers movie this isn't a genre rip-off, presenting instead an original and at times very black comic fantasy, with an odd pro-vegetarian subtext (the renegade vegan commandos inhabit the sewers beneath the city). The co-directors, both with obvious music video experience, are infatuated with their own clever camera work and production design (note the omnipotent fish-eye lens, able to roam though pipes and appliances and so forth), creating some elaborate sets which they later take great pleasure in destroying during the protracted climax. But once adjusted to the peculiar characters and hyperactive cartoon rhythm the film can be a lot of fun.

You will be amazed by the 3d, the story and the great visuals. One minor warning would be that the movie is not really one for children. A cartoon it may be, yet it takes a mind that is developed at least to the age of twelve to really get something out of it.

6493,"Endearing Hybrid of ADAPTATION and PARIS WHEN IT SIZZLES; Rob Reiner's return to the romantic comedy genre starts out pleasant but unremarkable -- that is, until the Central Casting Cuban loan sharks leave (though it's funny when they appear in the novel-within-the-movie as shady flamenco dancers) and wastrel writer Alex Sheldon (any relation to Paul Sheldon in Reiner's earlier adaptation of MISERY?  Hmm... :-) starts dictating his novel to smart, opinionated stenographer Emma Dinsmore. That's when ALEX & EMMA springs to life like a goofy cross between ADAPTATION and PARIS WHEN IT SIZZLES.  Luke Wilson is likable enough as Alex, but I must admit I think his brother Owen Wilson would've brought more verve and magnetism to the role. (Man, Owen Wilson and Kate Hudson together on the big screen -- I'd pay full admission price for that! But I digress... :-) As Emma, our household fave Kate Hudson plays a slightly starchier brunette version of her usual endearing self.  In particular, she seems to be having great fun playing not only Emma, but also several variations of the same constantly-revamped au pair/cook/all-purpose domestic in Alex's novel-in-progress as it's enacted onscreen.  I liked Emma as soon as I realized she and I share a certain quirk:  we both like to read the end of books before buying them (albeit for slightly different reasons:  Emma feels if the ending isn't good, it's a waste of time to read the book, whereas I like to see how the rest of the book happened to lead up to that particular ending.  But I'm digressing again -- this movie had that effect on me; make of that what you will! :-)!  I think writers would appreciate ALEX AND EMMA more than most moviegoers, if only because it does a pretty good job of getting into a writer's head, and the gags involving the novel-within-the-film are funny and inventive.  Interestingly, ALEX & EMMA is very loosely based on Dostoyevsky's relationship with his stenographer, who he wed in real life. In fact, the movie's original title, LOOSELY BASED ON A TRUE LOVE STORY, would also have fit the novel-within-the-film, which turns out to have more parallels with Alex's real-life experiences than he'd previously admitted.  (THOSE SWEET WORDS would've been a good title as well, especially since that's also the name of the Norah Jones song over the end credits.) Anyway, ALEX & EMMA would be a nice ""date movie"" for writers and the people who love them; now that it's available on home video, why not rent it for a snuggly movie-watching evening at home? :-) ",0.0

71057,"For me 9 is, sadly, one of the biggest disappointments of the year; And is ""sadly"" because I had such big expectations from 9 and certainly not only because master Tim Burton ""presents"" (he is also the producer) the movie (while the name of Timur Bekmambetov is very well known by me since one of the favourite movies of my cousin is Night Watch. However I have yet to see all of the Timur Bekmambetov movies, well I have seen some bits of Wanted). During these days there are many movies I really want to see playing in theaters here in Mexico City, pretty much *too* many movies since during these days I don't have much time mostly because of college. Last week we have the release of District 9 and The Informant! and last Friday, 23 October 2009, the release of Toy Story 3D (that is only playing for a week), Rec 2 and 9. Adding Year One (yes I know it is for most s*** but still I want to check it out, I'm a Jack Black fan baby!) there were yesterday, when I had finally a chance to go to the theater, 6 movies I really wanted to see and I chose 9 over those mentioned. 9 is an animated feature that looks great, with nice-looking characters and with a story that for moments seemed really interesting but that in the end is so thin that the runtime of the film, 79 minutes, ends being a real flaw. The main character, 9 (voice of Elijah Wood yet I saw it dubbed in Spanish), awakes knowing nothing and wanting to know, just like us the audience, just about everything. The dark setting is great and I liked the background with the scientist creating the main characters by giving them part of his soul (then each one of the nine represent a part of the scientist, the strong one, the coward one, etc.). But in the end what we have is a very conventional movie, certainly predictable and that, the worst thing, never really makes you care about something. For kids, judging for some reactions of my audience, this is just plain uninteresting and boring and for me this is a movie that made me think when it ended the classic ""that's all?"".",0.0

Mississippi Burning is a film much garlanded with awards, yet the charge about its uneasy focus on the fate of white activists is one that sticks. However, it is shot exquisitely, moves along with relentless power, and at least conveys an unequivocal message about racism, however unexceptional and self-congratulatory that may be. Hackman's turn as the pragmatic FBI man, prepared to spout racial hatred in order to catch his perpetrators, is mesmerising.

50005,"A visually extravagant film without much substance; I Love Zhang Yimou films but I think this is one of his least satisfying films. If you go to see this film, you shouldn't have expectations of seeing a wu-xia film, although it does have a few, exciting scenes of balletic martial arts a la Hero and House of Flying Daggers. The core of the film is the scheming within the royal family (a real nest of vipers) enclosed within the opulent prison of the imperial palace. However, there is not much of an emotional edge to the scheming. I found my mind wandering slightly. I wasn't lost in the movie. Perhaps it was as a result of the weak script. The acting was a mixed bag: Gong Li, as the queen, does anguish and female toughness very well. Chow Yun Fat seems to be playing a pantomime villain. Liu Ye, playing the crown prince, didn't seem convincing but this may have part of his character who (and this may not have come across clearly in the translation) seemed to be weak and effeminate, unsuited to the role of prince. Jay Chou, as the Queen's birth son and avenging angel, draws more interest. When he takes up arms to defend his mother it is very exciting and chivalric. The second half of the film does pick up as the various plots and intrigues come to a head and there was relief for me when the action starts and takes some of the heat off the constant intriguing. The battle scenes are average and I was disappointed that they seemed to rush by and lacked distinctness or any real bite (it does not compare with the battle of Helm's Deep in LOTR which for me must be a benchmark). The climactic battle does take place at night which accounts for some of its fuzziness though. As you would expect from a Zhang Yimou film it looks fantastic and colour plays a big role: in the costumes and the hypercolour sets. If you watched the film for an hour longer I think the fierce colours would become nauseating. I am very loyal to Hero and House of Flying daggers but after seeing this I almost wish Zhang Yimou would turn away from big-budget historical films and do something simpler or something more thought-provoking.",0.0
5540,"Cheesy but fun; I like mythology and so I enjoyed this movie, it is cheesy but enjoyable. A lot of scenes featured choppy and primitive animation, but at the time Clash was made it was state of the art, I'm sure. As a child I also was terrified of the many beasts and monsters Clash offered. The scene with Medusa is pretty cool, and I love the Krakon. Now that I am older and more schooled in Greek history and in the ways of the world, however, I must confess that I detect and odd homoerotic quality to this film, especially in the relationship between Perseus and Ammon. Perseus spends a lot of time bare-chested, is all I'm saying. I'm not gay, by the way, and I don't think this is a manifestation of a repressed homosexual lust for Harry Hamlin.",0.0
71057,"9 might have been the film of the year... but its a blockbuster shelf duster now.; 9, the film I've been looking forward to for months.... was little more then a disappointment. I was deeply surprised by 9's lack of story and strange character development. All the awesome action sequences in the world don't make up for a single unsympathetic character. The strange, almost thrown in occult sequences were not only out of place, they were infuriating. The story is about robots and scientists... why does it suddenly turn into a necronomicon horror wannabe with mystical symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of giving answers to what could have been excellently scary story devices?? How, what, when, why.... questions that bode asking only if you care and it becomes less and less likely that you will as you get away from the theater. A film like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth.... I would watch this film drawn in crayon if the story was good. But the filmmakers have relied on CGI wizardry and Tim Burtons name to draw in the crowd. Which... is what drew me in but failed to gain my respect. 9 could have been awesome... with a few more rewrites and a little more respect from its own creators.",0.0
1175,"Especially good in original French only version, if ya' don't speak French! :); I LOVE movies this weird - or weirder.  This is weirdness - way much so. Sure the story can be told a bunch of ways, but the style, colors, expressions, and other bits of 'Frenchness' thrown in make it worthwhile in a big way.  I especially love watching it in French, because I don't speak French.  With any movie that should be a primary barometer: if it holds up with the sound off, or in foreign (original) dialogue you cannot speak, then it is probably a cool movie! :)  You can actually follow the story and stuff without knowing what they are saying.  I look forward some day to seeing it with subtitles! (overdubbed movies in English tend to lose a lot of the atmosphere of original actors voices). I'd rank this up there with City Of Lost Children, and Amile - cute French movies.  Nobody does Cute like the French - check out the Cirque Du Soleil movies also!",0.0
5214,"Movie Made in Burns' Heyday is Showing its Age; The mid-1970s were George Burns' heyday. After several decades out of the movie business, he starred in several films that were surprising successes. He did stand-up comedy in Las Vegas. He appeared on talk shows and told silly jokes about smoking cigars, outliving his doctors, and hanging out with women one-fourth his age. He was an octogenarian movie star, and ""Oh, God!"" was released around the peak of his latter-day fame. The film begins with God (in the form of George Burns) appearing in supermarket manager Jerry's (John Denver) bathroom. God tells Jerry to get The Word out, so Jerry tells his story to a reporter (George Furth). This of course attracts the attention of several wackos and many theologians (including Jeff Corey, Paul Sorvino, and Donald Pleasance), much to the dismay of Jerry's wife (Teri Garr). There's an amusing courtroom sequence, and Jerry and God say goodbye and part ways. The movie is lightly entertaining with a warm message and has lots of good scenes, but trust me, it has no real laughs. Burns is his usual self, and Denver is surprisingly good in an uncharacteristic acting role. Garr and especially Sorvino (playing an outrageous TV evangelist) stand out in the supporting cast. Two inferior sequels with Burns but without Denver were later released. A lot of the shine has worn off ""Oh, God!"" since 1977. Burns and Denver are no longer with us, and George Burns' 1970s fame has been gone for 30 years. Many people probably know very little about either Burns or Denver, their memories fading every day. During the mid-1970s, Burns was an unlikely celebrity, with all the trappings that accompanied it (I used to cringe when Johnny Carson would imply that Burns was actually dating women in their early 20s). The novelty of seeing singer-songwriter John Denver in a movie is long gone. So, the general cultural atmosphere surrounding George Burns and this film has changed completely in the past 34 years. ""Oh, God!"" is still good, but to me the movie used to be a lot better, way back in 1977.",0.0
2302,"A remarkable cast makes this satiric comedy fresh.; MY COUSIN VINNY is just one of those ""feel good"" movies delivering some grins that won't wash away. An excellent cast includes Joe Pesci in one of his best roles as a hotshot lawyer. Expect a few unbelievable surprises from the irresistible guy who's smart enough to make one hilarious movie after another. He is downright likeable, and so is Marisa Tomei, a sassy and stylish figurine who was amazingly superb to take home the Best Actress Oscar. Both Pesci and Tomei have the colorful wits and personalities to make a wild pair for themselves (almost like living in the 50s for sure!). Also, the movie's best moment arises when a freight train disturbs Pesci's sleep at five in the morning. The deep downside is the latter portion: a climatic courtroom scene that, while up to the point of interest, runs terribly long and weak....until one of the film's cast members gets into the act! Still, it's worth plenty of good gags and good laughs that aren't so bugging. Pesci would look terrific in a torn-up leather jacket in front of the judge, to his ultimate disgrace!

4326,"The most powerful movie about racism; I am student in Sydney,Australia researching the civil rights movement of the 60s and this movie helps understand the racial tension, bigotry and violence prevailent in 1960s America. This is a totally different America from today with the ku klux klan terrorising neighbouring southern negros. This film, whilst often brutal, is a great depiction of this period, when crosses, churches and many negros' homes were burned. I have also come to believe that this film is based loosely on a true story, when the president of the USA dispatched a number of Federal Agents to search for 3 missing civil rights workers. This prompted one of the largest FBI manhunts in history. Gene Hackman is a former Southern Sheriff turned FBI, who teams up with a by-the-book agent Dafoe. Hackman is unorthodox by nature, and Dafoe continually wonders where the hatred comes from. ""Hatred is something that people are taught as soon as they are born"" - taught in schools basically, as the Deputys' wife says to Hackman.    Minor Spoiler: Soon, it is found that the sheriffs are part of the klan and are allegedly involved in the whole saga. Hackman's unorthodox methods are the ones that work, whilst Dafoe's methods do not. Hackman originally convinces Dafoe and they group with other agents to let fight back. This is when the movie gets really interesting. 9.5/10. ",0.0
50005,"Great dramatic acting within stunning visual jewel box; I am not sure what some of the critics and spoilers of the COTGF story were expecting... I agree with the comparisons of Shakespearan tragedies and royal family intrigues, and the reference to dysfunctional families and meltdowns. Actually, I was thinking a lot about the Lion in Winter transported in a Chinese setting. In the English drama, the King simply has the Queen imprisoned for her political rebellion. In this movie, the Emperor decides to slowly poison the Empress because of her affair with his oldest son. Both lead characters have their reasons for sticking to their planned course of action. Also, I was reminded about the Borgias and some of the other Italian, French and Greek royal dramas when emotions get totally out of hand. Why do some viewers say that emotions are over the top or that the females are too scantily clad? This movie shows that Chinese characters can have very powerful human emotions: sexual attraction,lust, filial love, greed, ambition... just like any other people in the world. And yes, the Chinese Imperial Palace is displayed on an extravagantly grand scale just because it is possible to do it only in China! China has more people than any other country and can afford the larger than life scenes in opulent settings. The Emperor is at first shown as a kind father who wants to maintain a harmonious balance of family and state. Ultimately, we find out that he is a hypocritical megalomaniac who obliterated his first wife's family in his bid to become Emperor and will not allow anyone to cross his will in his kingdom. Interestingly, even for a blood thirsty dictator, he has his soft spot, and that is his love for his first born son, who means well but appears rather weak of morals. The acting is very powerful: the epitome of Chinese acting is in the facial expressions within a restrained and mechanical setting (see Chinese opera) and both Gong Li and Cho Yung Fat do a great job in their roles. Watch the eyes and the hands... The occasional outbursts of real emotion when the character is pushed beyond its limits: see the Empress when she occasionally cannot help herself and tries to seduce the Crown Prince as a woman; see the Emperor when he toys with the Empress and shows her his kindness in prescribing herbal potions and her defiant reply makes him toss his arm in frustration; the final eruption of the despot when the youngest prince dares to rear up with hate... I wonder if any dysfunctional family that lives with a totally controlling father and experiences his insane fits of punishment can relate with the control and violence shown at the end. He tolerates the Empress because she is a princess and very decorative and the mother of his 2 younger sons, and he even tolerated silently her affair for a while, but he will not tolerate her efforts to usurp him publicly. I can predict that the Empress will die a slow and humiliating death unless she finds a way to kill herself first. What I picked up very clearly is the subtle form of psychological cruelty that underlies the Chinese concept of revenge. Many long-standing cultures understand this form of torture very well which goes above and beyond killing a person. Think about the movie Jean De La Florette where the protagonist is slowly killed by the grinding labor of finding non-existing water. It is the slowly grinding down of a person's will through day-in and day-out abuse. See the daily poisoning of the Empress under the guise of caring for her health. See the impossible ending offer to the rebellious prince to choose between killing his own mother with regular offering of the herbal potion versus death under his father's hand - the prince decides to end his life to get out of this insane set of situation. He actually succeeds in comparison to the eldest prince who tries suicide the previous evening and fails to slice his own throat. Yes, the Emperor is ultimately an evil man because he sacrifices all that he loves for his political ambition to be the boss, but he has his human dimensions: he is attracted as a man to the 2 women he loves most in his life, as seen in their rare intimate moments together and he loves the first son unconditionally... Personally, I think that the characters are very well developed because they are complex, obsessed and quite multi-dimensional in their basic human drives. They make sense within the constraints in which they are cast.",0.0

Her father in Law (Lemon) is a pro-government conservative, out of touch with his son's political views, moral views and seems to be at odds on why his son married Julie Horman. The tension between the characters, at times nearly accusatory in tone, is riveting.  The two times I saw this film, you could feel the anger of the audience as they left the theater. (The first time was at William and Mary, not exactly the bastion of liberalism) Most impressive of all is that with countless thousands of porn films, controversial pseudo-historical films, and some very anti-government movies; Missing remains as the only film to be officially sanctioned/criticized by the United States (mostly at the insistence of Henry Kissinger).",0.0

Unfortunately the Gods start getting involved and messing things up, and Callibos wants Andromeda for himself. Perseus must get the head of Medusa to kill the Kraken before it eats his love. Certain aspects of this film have not dated so well. The performances often clash, with strong serious roles from Smith and Olivier but rather flat participation from the lead Hamlin. No matter though, because Clash of the Titans is like a child's imagination slapped on screen. Harryhausen's incredible effects work is still amazing to watch, with Medusa still being a terrifying stand-out. Sometimes the individual creations and the live action doesn't quite blend, but the story smooths over the rough edges. They really should continue to make films like this, even if it's just for a quick relief from CGI.",0.0
1148,"Synthetic Actors; Spoilers herein. I've been writing IMDB comments for about a year and a half now. I started with an interest in exploring how directors deal with the uniqueness of their vision, especially when self-aware or self-referential. (Self-aware is when the film shows how it is made, like the obvious effects in `Beetlejuice.' Self-referential is when the film comments on itself, like when the story is about a filmmaker (or writer) who is worried about a technique that one can see in the film.) Over time, I've become aware of what some directors call the actor problem. The public thinks of films first in terms of the people they see, the actors. And those actors drive the business. The problem is that actors have somewhat different goals than filmmakers, and often a strong actor will ruin the effect intended by a gifted director. So I've been studying the various techniques and instances where each party succeeds in a solution that works. They are few, it seems. Here is the ultimate solution: invent the actors. Shucks, invent their whole world. Invent their reason to be. Walt Disney shocked the whole system when he first did this. He created the actor, but not their world: Micky and later Donald and the others belong more or less in the ordinary world. However, the roadrunner and coyote belong in different world, one where the emotional physics comes from the mind of the filmmaker. We come to know just how that world works. Both the actors and their world come from a single mind. Now with claymation comes a particularly unique development: the actor is created, the world is created. But the camera and lighting is `real,' and modern notions of camera movement are used, just as in a `real' film. The technique is self-aware: one can see that the characters are clay, see the thumbprints. And it works, largely because one man's mind can be coherently presented in the context of real movies. `The Wrong Trousers' is the peak of this man's mind though. The first film was better in the sense of literally exploring the possibilities of another world and its physics. The claycraft was more primitive and appealing, but the story was weak and the actors hadn't really learned how to use their faces. The film after this `Shave,' necessarily involved many collaborators, which diluted the vision. And more people meant more costs which means lowered risks which means vanilla story. That ultimately led to the slightly clever but wholly mainstream `Chicken Run.' So this film is a peak of sorts. A couple things make it uniquely fine: the strong self-reference and the cinematic expression. The `Wallace' world is fully Hitchcockian here, moreso than before or after. Hitch's innovation was to advance the drama by making the camera act, in subliminal but powerful ways. Nick has studied and mastered this -- it is the real power of `trousers.' The technique is as much a matter of the camera humor as anything else. And the story is self-referential as well: the basic problem of the filmmaker is that each film cements the future of films that follow. There is a straitjacket of expectations from the viewer that you cannot escape. One example: if you have a spaceship battle, it must rumble and flash like the movies before or it will not seem real, though the actual behavior of such a battle could never really appear so. All film -- down to the smallest detail -- is so constrained. It is something deeper than formula. In his natural state, Wallace's `clothing' is unconstrained, only the manner in which he has to put it on. So here we have Wallace dressed by mechanical means. That's the normal state, Nick and Wallace tinker with those mechanics to have fun. But now comes the real challenge: how to put Wallace in a fully Hitchcock world with all the plot formula that entails. It is mostly mechanical, that. Well, in a self-referential way, you put Wallace in some automatic, mechanical pants, that literally walk him through the plot, that literally drag him through all the stuff you need to have a `real' Hitchcock film. It's a brilliant notion, one that ranks as the most successful in the history of film. But Nick is already creatively worn out or more likely compromised by the system. The torch passes to Pixar.",1.0
1175,"Inventive, fun and crazy!; ""Delicatessen"" is one of those very few movies that are able to accomplish it all. There's a bit of comedy, horror, thriller, mystery and adventure, all spiced up with surrealism and outstanding cinematography. It's amazing how well the movie builds its (very believable) post- apocalyptic universe, where people are doing everything to survive. Literally everything. Well, except one character! (Watch it to understand!) The actors do they job splendidly, every character is built up flawlessly having their own personalities and features, making all of them extremely interesting, even if some of them are not involved with the main plot. Each of the tenants of ""Delicatessen"" have their own very weird quirks that make them stand out on their own, without wasting even one scene with pointless content. The movie is entertaining through every shot. The music is amazing as well, portraying the accordion french music outstandingly which also gives the movie a whole lot of personality and character. It just fits perfectly. Photography is top notch, with the tones of brown / yellow and green giving a very weird, often dark, oppressive or just downright surreal feeling. Overall, this is one hell of a movie. Excellent from the beginning to the end. Some of the scenes here are just so memorable you will be wanting to watch them over and over... You'll fall in love with each characters' quirks, and you will laugh, cringe and think throughout the whole experience. ""Delicatessen"" should be watched by everyone. Flawless 10 out of 10.",0.0

Jim Carrey seemed like he was just going through the motions, following a script which he seemed almost embarrassed about himself at times.

I really liked the plot outline with the narrative characters developing alongside Alex and Emma.I actually felt moved in the beginning when Emma lost the stenograph pages which surprised me.One major niggle did occur to me though about the whole '30 days' thing i would have given the film a higher rating if it had focused on wit and humour than macho men/suspense. After a while i also felt that it needed more edge something more than just a battle of the sexes. Anyway it diverted my attention plausibly and i give a rating of: 5/10,0.0
19,"""ALLLRIGHTY then... ""; Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) travels to Africa for his next assignment. Ace has been hired by posh gentleman, Vincent Cadby (Simon Callow) to find a bat that was stolen from a local African tribe's village. Assisted by Fulton Greenwall (Ian McNeice), Ace searches through the village for clues and questions all potential suspects, as he looks to solve the case before an inter-tribal wedding is due to take place. The movie is mainly good in the jokes department. The first third is by far the best with the funniest jokes taking place then. The best of which is when Ace thrashes a Jeep through the jungle in a bid to get to the consulate quicker. The second third feels a bit slow, and although there are still many good jokes, they're not as good as the first third. But by the final third things begin to pick up again. The alligator wrestling and the final ten minutes of the movie are especially hilarious. As you would expect Jim Carrey steals the show with his super cartoonish acting in both the physical and verbal departments. Everything he says and does in the movie he appears to have thought long and hard about how to present it; and believe me, he presents it in the funniest way possible. There are also solid performances by Ian McNeice, who plays the mild-mannered Greenwall, and Simon Callow, who plays the posh consulate owner, Cadby. The other cast members are top notch too with McNeice a loyal sidekick to Ventura who helps him whenever he needs it. Callow is the second best behind Carrey and is a slimy,creepy and downright horrible character and plays it with every fiber of his acting and his scenes with Carrey are fantastic. Other actors like Bob Gunton excel as he shares a spoof torture sequence with Carrey who uses his eye to funny effect whilst we see a young Sophie Okonedo as the princess of a tribe and she is beautiful and we see her talent early on, the rest play they part with Carrey even if they are a bit wasted.

8838,"An involving and amusing melodrama; Alice has a 11 year old boy and a loveless marriage.  When her husband dies she up sticks and leaves town to pursue her last job as a singer.  Getting a job in a piano bar she gets into more trouble with men and move town again.  Settling into a waitressing job she hates, Alice continues to search for something better. Those of us who only see Scorsese as `the guy who does gangster movies' should check out one of his earlier films and then realise why they are wrong.  Also they should check out `King of Comedy' easily one of his better films but criminally undervalued and years ahead of it's time. Ahem, anyway, back to this movie.  Scorsese has managed to make a film from a female point of view.  Whereas many of his more successful films were male orientated, this takes the female side well.   The story manages to be both funny but also touching and real.  The story may be a little rambling and quite melodramatic but it works well.  The gentle comedy is of the type between friends as opposed to elaborate sketches  this helps keep it feeling real. Scorsese cuts back on the heavily stylised direction evident in later films but this does help the content work.  As always he uses music to good effect, even if there is a bit too much in the way of C&W.  Burstyn does very well as Alice and carries the film well without letting it become a grind.  Lutter III is great for a child, his irreverent humour prevents him being a `cute kid' type.  Kristofferson is good value in a small part, his character is just about a good enough mix of hot and cold to be real.  Ladd is great in support and very funny.  Keitel and Foster are both good and indicate why Scorsese came back to them for more in later films. Overall, I imagine that those looking for more F-words, gangsters and De Niro will feel that this isn't a good Scorsese film.  However it is proof of his talent that he is able to deliver a very good `house wife melodrama'.  Of course looking over his work the focus will be on other films but here he turns a TVM weepy into an involving and amusing melodrama.",0.0

8838,"Scorsese evolves into a ""Hollywood"" director; Burstyn is fantastic; Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore at times might not look it to those who don't check (or care to check) the director credit, but Martin Scorsese- in the interim between Mean Streets and Taxi Driver- took on a film where he could prove to his detractors wrong. Indeed, Scorsese can direct anyone well, man, woman, child (just look at Kundun if you don't believe his knack for directing non-professional along with pros, besides the point). In this story, Ellen Burstyn plays the title character, left abandoned with her son after her husband dies. She has to make ends meet as a waitress in Phoenix in order to make her dream for her and her son come true- getting to Monterey. Enter in that cool presence that is Kris Kristofferson, and the film goes into not-so-conventional territory (some would argue up till the end). For acting students, this is one of those kinds of films one has to check out- Burstyn, in her Oscar winning role, plays between kind, angry, frightened, scared, and strong in her role, trying to break past other female types that had been around in films at the time. There is also ample room for a small role for Harvey Keitel, as a smooth talker with a bad temper. Scenes between the two of them are like method acting staples of 70's movie-making (not to downplay Kristofferson or Diane Ladd's performances either). And then there's Scorsese, injecting his style sometimes without much of a trace, and sometimes so forcefully that one who knows his work well can sit up and take notice. The improvisation he lets the actors have in scenes is so delicate and precise that it adds to the reality- or the illusions- of most scenes. There is also a very funny (in a weird way) beginning to the film as a parody of farm-girl good times goes on. A recommended treat- those who are die-hards for the Scorsese crime films may be perplexed, but for the Lifetime TV crowd who usually wouldn't go near a Scorsese film at the video store will likely be more pleased than I was (or maybe not- this film has as much detractors as defenders for its feminist themes).",0.0

A sheep named Shaun steals the show here.  Wallace is marginally more lively in this one.  All in all, well worth seeking out and fairly easy to get.  Highly recommended.",1.0
6101,"Tense Political Thriller; Lemmon gives perhaps his best performance since ""The Apartment"" as the distraught father who overcomes his curmudgeonly ways and comes to respect the liberal views of his son and daughter-in-law. Spacek is equally good. The film gets off to a shaky, confusing start but it's not long before everything comes into focus. Costa-Gavras keeps things moving at a fast clip, not letting the film drag for a second. The presentation also seems fresh, including the straightforward way that the flashback scenes are handled. It's interesting that the name of the country is never mentioned, although it later becomes clear that the action is taking place in Santiago.",0.0
5214,"God bless George Burns; This is a really wonderful film that is masterful in every way. George Burns joked that when they offered him this part that no one could have played it because no one was closer to God's age. However, he was nervous about playing it and consulted the greatest actors about how to do it. Let me explain this film, the two leads were one person (John Denver) who was well known as a singer but who had never acted before in his life and another (George) who at almost 80 had only one other acting credit (The Sunshine Boys). However, this unlikely duo made movie magic! It is a truly amazing accomplishment and a joy watching them together. This is a film that is as important today as it was when it came out almost a quarter of a century ago. We all need to realize God's love and his message and no one did a better job of giving that then George did in this wonderful film, especially in the end in the courtroom speech that he gives. This man had spent his life as just a comedian not as an actor, but he deserved another Oscar for his outstanding work in this wonderful film. Carl Reiner deserves kudos for his wonderful directing job and Terri Garr gives a great performance as the understanding wife as does Paul Sorvino as the corrupt evangilist (they picked a safe target). However, the cheers and handshakes belong to George Burns and John Denver alone!!!. They have both left us and we are the poorer for it, but I hope that both of them are having a wonderful time in Heaven!",0.0

1223,"The debut of Wallace and Gromit; This is their first short film and introduction to England's famous clay animated duo. This was first air on BBC channel back in 1989. The animation is well done, has a similar style you'd find in other stop-motion animated films before this. But this is unlike the other stop-motion films you've seen. There's something special in this type of clay animated short. It has to do with an inventor ""Wallace"" and his silent dog ""Gromit"" planning to go somewhere for what the British would call a vacation ""holiday"". Wallace finds out there's no more cheese, so they decide to go somewhere that has cheese. And they picked the right place that has cheese....The moon! It has humor, and some neat engineering. It's very memorable and perfectly safe for the whole family to watch. Wallace and Gromit is one of a kind to see again and again.",1.0

The first of Mr. Park's W&G cartoons that I know of (A Grand Day Out), was amazing in the detail of the claymation animation. Each of the next two was better!

6101,"An Exercise in Propaganda - Major Spoilers; I recently saw this movie with friends. To say I disliked it is to put it mildly. It seemed to me to be propaganda of the worst order, with a lot of accusatory inferences that US officials were guilty of major crimes, but saying next to nothing concrete. The central premise of the movie was so vague and internally inconsistent that it's hard to believe that anyone could take it seriously. But apparently a huge audience has. So here goes. The central premise is that the victim-hero while escorting a lady friend to a seaside resort in what is obviously Chile, stumbles upon a nest of US operatives, and sees so much that he has to be eliminated.We see him and the friend breakfasting at a seaside resort with some companionable older people, who chat pleasantly with them (the couple apparently spend the night  the time sequence is as vague as everything else) - and then invite them to a barbecue, and apparently tell all. Since he knows too much, he has to be eliminated. Now this makes no sense at all. If the knowledge were so dangerous that possession means death, why are top secret operatives blabbing in the first place? At one point, the movie speculates that they assumed, being American, that the young man is on their side. When they learn better, they have him killed. Oh, please. This was 1971  the US had gone through the most tumultuous decade in its history. Top secret agents are going to casually talk to a youthful stranger socially? Not to mention that these encounters take place at a well-known seaside resort (not exactly the kind of place where the CIA billets people.) Per the dialog, the place is 'crawling with uniformed officers'. So what about the other guests? The maids? The hotel staff? They're deaf and dumb to all this? Why aren't they targets? The movie's theory fails at the most elementary level. Although the victim's companion would know as much as him, no one threatens her. The mystery of the actual relationship of the two can serve as an example of the vagueness throughout. The victim hero takes the girl out to the resort and meets one of the supposed agents at breakfast. So they may have spent the night. So were they having an affair? At one point, the dad (Jack Lemmon) asked his young widow (Sissy Spackek) that question. She ducks the question, ""Oh dad, you know what Chuck was like."" That is typical of the entire movie. There is another absolutely baffling scene, where the young widow is invited to the home of the US official whom the movie accuses of being most culpable. Inexplicably  and I do mean inexplicably  she bathes there. While she is in the tub, the bad guy inexplicably enters, in an intrusive way that most married women would resent if their husband did so, and there is confrontational dialog, with eyes glaring and all the rest. Huh? Why does she feel comfortable taking a bath there? By what earthly right would he feel entitled to enter the bathroom? The movie doesn't even attempt to explain. The script goes on to implicate the State Department and CIA, on the basis that 'no national official would execute an American' without CIA approval. The premise of the movie is that the coup has been some sort of sudden, overnight seizure of power, engineered by the CIA. However, to the extent that the unnamed nation is Chile under Allende, which it obviously is, the premise is false to the point of being cynical. Space is too short to get into detail, and the site does not permit links. Suffice it to say that the Allende government was in real trouble throughout all of 1973, with the Supreme Court denouncing Allende for his violations of Constitutional guarantees in May and the Assembly doing the same in August. (These developments are usually overlooked by those who want to canonize Allende.) Copper prices had fallen dramatically in 1972 and 1973  a hundred thousand women took to the streets in the summer to protest the high price of sugar. The entire country was in an uproar. The point is that this was not a coup organized by a foreign country that stole democracy from the Chilean people. It came straight out of the political culture of Chile. While it is intuitively likely that the CIA provided aid and comfort, there is no indication at all that it ever had a veto over the Chilean government. Meaning that it is simply flat out not the case that 'no American could be shot' without CIA approval. Nor is there any reason to believe that the CIA marshaled operatives anywhere in Chile to assist. All this happened before the notorious Church Committee hearings in 1976, anything but a whitewash. It didn't find anything like what is suggested in the movie. (The State Department didn't do itself any favor by classifying a contemporary memo related to Charles Horman, the luckless young man who is the model for the hero. In 2011, however, they were finally released, with shouts to high heaven from the movie's supporters, for they do indeed contain a mention of the CIA. But if you download it which I did, you'll find the reference is as speculative as the movie. It leads nowhere.) So this is the worst kind of propaganda. Since there are a lot of problems with the case it wants to make, it chooses the method of vague innuendo and muddled narrative. Nathaniel Davis, the ambassador to Chile at the time, filed a $150 million dollar lawsuit for defamation. He lost, and rightly so, since there is a First Amendment and this is fair comment. But defamatory? Oh, yeah. Almost certainly.",0.0
8838,"so great...so unforgettable..so heartwarming...so bittersweet that it becomes one of the most underrated film of Martin Scorsese.....; Martin Scorsese who is now known for his crime epics like Mean Streets, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York and The Departed among others like dirty-realism Taxi Driver, sports Raging Bull, comedy The King of Comedy and After Hours, revenge thriller Cape Fear and dramas from various lives like Boxcar Bertha, New York, New York, The Color of Money, The Last Temptation of Christ, The Age of Innocence, Kundun, Bringing Out the Dead, The Aviator, Shutter Island, Hugo, The Wolf of Wall Street and the latest Silence. But no one to only some in those ones, remembers about a film that is more deeper than what it shows us on the surface and the film i am talking about is Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore is one such film that needs a special attention, reverence and deservedness that it have been eluded for years since 1975 with a revival of re-screening among audience and lovers of cinema of Martin Scorsese. this film has all the real life components that touches one's heart and shows exactly of how's one life as a discouraged mother, a crack- brain son and as a wife of a husband whom she married but doesn't finds love between them even after his sudden death and a lost and redeeming father gets up when life hits hard and makes us lose all of our softness. this film if i am not wrong is also a tribute that Martin Scorsese pays to his mother, Catherine Scorsese who raised her up under difficult circumstances. All of the actors such as Ellen Burstyn who plays the role of a mother, widowed wife and as aspiring singer; Alfred Lutter as her son who is looks un-fittable in the surroundings he is living under; Diane Ladd as a waitress who is hard to understand but is soft to understand others; Valerie Curtin as another waitress who is fragile and acts like a leaf all the time; Kris Kristofferson as David who has lost his family by not standing for them and wants to redeem through by helping Alice & Tommy as his own and last by the least, Harvey Keitel as Ben who charms his way to get Alice but is un- shadowed of what he is when he shows his true self to her while fighting with Lane Bradbury as Rita: have done their best and full of realist act. so, if you haven't a got a DVD of their yet, get it now since it's hard to get.",0.0
1223,"Absolutely smashing!; This is the first Wallace and Gromit film and while not quite as polished as later ones (hence the 9 and not a score of 10), it was a magnificent film. In light of its fantastic graphics and lovely story, it was nominated for the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film--which it lost, oddly enough, to another film from the same studio! CREATURE COMFORTS is a much simpler film--shorter and with a single gimmick (which you either loved or hated--I hated it) and I have no idea why the Wallace and Gromit short lost--it was head and shoulders above this other film. This short has to do with both introducing the characters as well as giving them something to do--in this case, taking a trip to the moon to satisfy Wallace's pathological love for cheese! It's got all the expected gags and style--a lovely film really and one you MUST watch (really)!",1.0
5214,"Hardly Scriptural, But Entertaining & Memorable; This is a great example of how the secular world would like to picture God, even with concessions to Believers such as, ""Yes, God is still alive."" Unfortunately, in the name of humor - and it IS funny - they make the fatal mistake most Biblically- ignorant people make: they put God on the same level as human beings. So, here we see God portrayed humorously by George Burns but really not a whole lot more than any good human being, anything but holy and perfect God. For just one example, in the film, ""God"" admits he makes mistakes. If that were true, he wouldn't be God. Puh-leeze. There are tons of secular feel-good stuff in here and that satisfied the masses, which embraced this film enough to have a horrible sequel or two. Even the title of the movie is blasphemous, using the Lord's name as an exclamation and nothing else. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed watching this. IIt's a nice movie with some good laughs and some memorable scenes....but not the Truth, folks. Mr. Denver and Mr. Burns could both tell you that now. By the way, kudos for Denver's performance. For a guy who was strictly a singer, his acting was excellent in here....and it was always fun to watch and hear Burns.",0.0

5214,"Oh, God! What A Great Little Pictuire!; IN STARK CONTRAST to the big budget, super fx,giant who's who casts and plenty of flesh attributes that so many movies gravitate toward, we occasionally get some small co$t, good story, regular-type characters with little or no computer animation nor sexploitation in evidence. And, surprising as it may be to some of these Hollywod Big Shots, the movie is eminently successful and even critically acclaimed. WHEN WE LOOK for examples of such films, we are inundated with many. Just imagine when we all saw titles like ROCKY, MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING and the all time underdog of kiddie films, BENJI. Inspite of all of the conventional wisdom from entertainment world sharpies, films like these do, somehow, get made. CONCERNING THE CIORCUMSTANCES leading up to the exhibiting of a film such as this OH GOD (Warner Bros./1977), it in itself, is certainly a ""Celluloid Miracle."" THE DEPICTION OF anyone who is so ""Middle Class"" or even ""Blue Collar"" as to attend Church, Synagogue, Temple or Mosque regularly is considered to be too outdated and 'corny' for so many Hollywood money men. Hedonism, epicurean-ism, greed and narcissism are considered to be the norm and are all too often glorified. IN SHARP CONTRAST, this little, inexpensive and family oriented film scores big number$ at the Box Office$ receipt$; which is, of course, a main objective in any studio. (Afyter all, it is a business!) OUR STORY: Grocery Store Manager, Jerry Landers finds the rat race of everyday life to be just to much. Being frustrated at every turn, he finds himself automatically saying or shouting, ""Oh, God!"" After some time, he has an experience where an elderly man (Geotrge Burns) appears to him. He tells Jerry that he is indeed who Jerry has been summoning for so long, being God, Himself! AS WE WOULD expect, Jerry's natural tendency toward skepticism wins out as we find ourselves bearing witness to a multitude of embarrassing and very funny situations. The gag situations are basic, with nothing of any real originality in evidence; save for one small, newly ordained tidbit of screen comedy. That would be the personality and delivery of non-actor and star, John Denver. ALL THROUGH THE story, we find controversy and conflict with Jerry Landers' unbelievable claims of having talked to the Almighty. Be it his boss, his wife (Terri Garr-woo, woo, woo, woo!), his neighbors or leaders of the Major Faiths, the reactions are the same end results; that being a hilarious and ever building audience reaction. BUT, THE FRIVOLITY only goes so far as the comical aspects find themselves being tempered with what can only be interpreted as being a 'Message!' BUT THE STORY (as would a real life situation) demand consultation with a ""Higher Authority."" In this case, a committee of inquiry is assembled; which is composed of prominent clerics from all across the spectrum of believers. We have: Barry Sullivan (Bishop Reardon), Jeff Corry (Rabi Silverstone), Titos Vandis (Eastern Orthodox Bishop) and others. NEEDING AN ADDITIONAL plot twist, the scenarist opts for having God/George Burns taking exception to one member of this Omnibus of Ecumenical Ecclesiastics as being unworthy and a wealth seeking phony. The writer picks a politically target in actor Paul Sorvino's characterization of Tele Evangelist, Rev. Willie Williams. (Southern Whites and Fundamentalist Christians are and have been fair game for vilification in both life and fiction.) THE CRESCENDO OF the story is finally reached in the Judicial Proceedings that follow. This also brings us what is arguably the best gag in the movie. That is, when God is called upon to take the stand and, when sworn in with the words, ""......so help you God!"", George Burns replies, ""So help me, me!"" OTHERWISE, THE COURT scenes are cleverly played in the manner of those in Frank Capra's MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN (Columbia, 1937). The cast is also staffed with many veterans and guest stars such as: Donald Pleasance, Ralph Bellamy, William Daniels, Barnard Hughes, George Furth, Dinah Shore and even Director, Carl Reiner steps before the camera to join the fun. IN THE END, God just vanishes; having left his message with the John Denver/Jerry Landers character and to us, the audience; that we may think over what it meant. OH GOD is a movie that both entertains and provokes thought. As an additional asset, it proved to be a BOX OFFICE $UCCE$$! NOW YOU Hollywood big shots, isn't that a plan? So, do it already!",0.0
1223,"Grand; Although A Grand Day Out is arguably the weakest of the three existing Wallace and Gromit films, it's still very funny, and very entertaining. This was my first W and G experience.  I heard the uncontrolled sounds of hysterical laughter from my family in the next room as a refrigerator on the moon dreamt of skiing down slopes (don't ask, watch.)  Everyone, from ages 3-103 will be at least slightly amused by any W and G skit.  I also recommend A Close Shave and The Wrong Trousers, which won an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.",1.0
745,"The Best Yet......; Of all the W&G films A Close Shave is by far the best of all. Not only is the animation far more polished & detailed than its earlier predecessors, A Grand Day Out (1992) and The Wrong Trousers ('93). But in addition the story is far more engaging, light & humourous compared to the darker more mechanical nature of TWT (my least favourite of the three). For the first time, A Close Shave introduces an extra dimension to the W&G pairing, in the form of Wendolene, a lady woolshop owner who Wallace falls in love with when both he & Gromit clean her shop windows. With the addition of a female into the story we are given a little more character development concerning Wallace. The previous two stories only centred around his self-serving interests in cheese, inventions, making money and relying on his pet pooch to get him out of sticky situations. But in ACS we are offered a more rounded perspective of his personal life and his keeness to have a woman sharing his home at long last. As the film progresses the relationship between the couple grows, in spite of all the dangers & hazards that they face along the way. And by the end of the film we are left on tenterhooks as to whether Wendolene will finally move in with W&G for good! So not only is the animation and attention to detail significantly improved over TWT but so too is the characterisation and storyline. The voice of Wallace, Peter Sallis, is dependable & easy on the ear, even though he doesn't have much to say compared to the previous films. But it is to Gromit where the real plaudits lie. Because he can't speak (or bark apparently!) we have to rely on his facial expression to understand how he feels & reacts to those around him. Because of the wonderful attention to animated detail Nick Park and his crew have spent, we can connect & relate very easily to Gromit's body language, especially within his eyes. I don't think I've ever seen such wonderful expressions since Laurel & Hardy. In fact the next time you have the benefit of seeing a L&H film take note of Ollie's facial expressions to-camera and you'll understand the comparison between him & Gromit. Its now 6 years since the last W&G installment and it is to be hoped that Nick Park will do another follow up. I only hope he doesn't rely on lifeless cgi for his animation technique. On average it took NP between 2 to 3 years for each of the W&G episodes. But it was worth the wait. However, the Dreamworks Studio to which NP is affiliated, may not like having to wait such a long time for the next installment to be made, a may insist on using computer animation rather than clay to speed the production process up somewhat. Chicken Run (2000), NP's first full-feature movie in conjunction with Dreamworks was, on the whole, ok. But the story seemed so formulaic & safe that you just knew the studio had ""influenced"" the production more than NP would have liked. And as a result you get a bland film built on hype. So I only hope the next W&G doesn't follow the same route otherwise the entire W&G franchise will be ruined for the sake of the mighty dollar yet again. ****/***** ",1.0
