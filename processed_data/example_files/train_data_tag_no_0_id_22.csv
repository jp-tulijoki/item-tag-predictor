2571,"Plain and simply brilliant.; If I would have commented on this flick after the first time that I watched it then I probably would have only rated it 8 or possibly 9. It is so true that to fully appreciate this film you have to watch it 3 maybe even four times. I thought this film film was brilliantly original, clever, atmospheric and well thought out. It's especially interesting to see how much effort and skill went into making it. The actors for example, took 4/5 months just to learn the martial art skills necessary for the Morpheus/Neo fight simulation. The cast is great (especially Trinity in that sexy cat suit, wow!, she has a lovely ass!). The direction is superb and I just cannot find a fault with this masterpiece, apart from at the end, where it becomes a bit corny in that in order for Neo to become 'The One', Trinity must confess her love for him. Rather corny but after all, this is the one thing that the machines which have taken over cannot feel or relate to, feelings such as love or compassion. Subsequently it is this, that leads to their downfall as Neo wakes up and kicks Agent Smith's ass!. A must watch for any viewer & one of only a few films I will give full marks to. Rating 10/10. Master Class.",0.0
8874,"Cool zombie comedy; Shaun of The Dead is pretty mediocre flick in the beginning. I've seen so much of standard British sitcom humor, that it failed to impress. But once the zombies started causing havoc, the film became really funny and entertaining. It was cool to see the film not shying away from all the gore. Good throwback to the old days, when horror movies had some guts! It's pretty well directed with some cool camera angels and stuff like that. And I really liked the actors. Especially Shaun and Ed were really good. The first 20-30 minutes are kinda boring, but it's really good after that. I would give the film ***/****.",0.0
3751,"The Future of Film Animation; The animated film industry has been instantly revolutionized with the first full-length feature film, Chicken Run.  From the makers of the nifty little Wallace and Gromit shorts, Chicken Run is a splendid adventure film that is well made in every way. Chicken Run is, in a way, a prison film.  The prisoners are the chickens on a small farm dominated by a sadistic Mrs. Tweedle, who becomes obsessed with making chicken pies for more money. Unlike Disney productions, Chicken Run is not manipulative, and it's characters aren't one-dimensional.  Every line is well written, and the score is excellent.  Although most of the chickens are physically hard to tell apart, the voices are diverse enough for the viewer to tell who's who.  This is simply a terrific film, and it is the history of film animation. O  O  O  O  O  O  O  O ",0.875
6537,"The best thing I can say: It Didn't Suck!; I know that most of us went into the theater with this silent prayer in our minds: ""Please don't suck! PLEASE dont SUCK! PLEASE DON'T SUCK!"" First, the good news: It didn't SUCK! Now, the not so good news: It wasn't great either. The best I can do for this movie is say it was pretty good. If it were a stand alone movie, that would be enough. But since it follows two of the best sci-fi movies ever made, it's a bit of a letdown, but not much. This movie is certainly worth watching in the theaters, if for nothing else than the action sequences. Of which there are some doozies! The chase scene with the crane alone is worth the price of admission! The acting in this movie was well done. Being an action flick, I'm not looking for Oscar worthy performances, but I did start to care about these people. Kristanna Lokken did quite well as the T-X, her performance as such rivals that of Robert Patrick as the T-1000 in T2, and she has a nice butt to boot! Nick Stahl fills in quite well as John Connor, though I still would rather have seen Edward Furlong reprise his role and give the film more of a connection to its predecessors. Claire Danes works well too, though her part seems a bit like a redux of Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor from the first film, even to the point where John Connor says to her in a scene, ""You remind me of my mother!"". Then of course there's Ah-nuld! what can I say? The man was born to play this part! The only problem I had with this rendition of the T-800 (or T-101 in this film) was that for the first 2/3 of the movie, the script relies so heavily on the amusing one-liners (in their defense, they ARE funny!)that the movie threatens to become a parody of itself. Jonathon Mostow does a good job directing, but I really would have liked to have seen what Cameron would have done with this movie. His absence I think is what stops this movie from being great. The biggest gripe I have with this movie is its ending. While it does set up a possible T4 movie, it is anti-climatic to say the least, and furthermore in contradiction to the theme of T2. I give it a 6.5 out of 10.",0.0
6537,"Definitely inferior, but it's not THAT badÂ…; So yesterday I watched Under Siege 2 and today I watched Terminator 3 for the first time since I saw it in theaters when it was first released. I remember being hugely disappointed when I first saw it, but I noticed that I enjoyed it much more the second time around. It's better than I thought the first time I saw it, but it should be noted that there is no arguing with the fact that, even though it does a good job of furthering the Terminator story, director Jonathan Mostow is just not taking it very seriously. That becomes clear almost immediately, as the Terminator walks into a bar during ladies night and has a run-in with a gay dancer, ultimately walking out of the bar clad in leather and putting on a purple pair of glittery star-shaped sunglasses. The entire movie became one of those rare theater experiences where everyone is laughing out loud and making jokes about the movie but nonetheless enjoying it, and no one seems to mind all the talking and giggling. It's immediately clear that Arnold is just not the same guy he was only ten years earlier. For some reason, he seems a lot more than ten years older here than he was in Judgement Day, and to make matters worse, his English seems to have slipped. His accent is much stronger now than it was before and it affects his performance. It's hard not to laugh out loud when he approaches Claire Dames and says, ""Catherine Broo-stuh?"" In the movie's defense, I loved the addition that it made to the Terminator story. We are given believable reasons for why there are still terminators even after the only chips were destroyed at the end of T2, and the ""rise of the machines"" is also well presented. The biggest problem with the movie is the casting. Claire Dames is good in her role of Catherine Brewster, a key element of the humans resistance against the machines, although she is just a little too recognizable. But Nick Stahl? Are you serious? From the very beginning of the movie, where he is shown as an older man in the future, Stahl is wildly miscast as John Connor. Why didn't they just cast Eddie Furlong again? He's not the same guy he was back in 1992, but I can't imagine anyone else fitting the character as well. And surely he wasn't too busy, unless he was more interested in acting in the disappointing and instantly forgettable crime thriller ""3 Blind Mice"" than making another Terminator film. Such a thing hardly seems possible. The other problem is that Kristannak Loken, who is undeniably beautiful, just doesn't understand the nature of her character, nor does director Jonathan Mostow. In the original film, Reese explained to Sarah Connor that the first Terminators had latex skin and were easy to spot, but the new ones had real organic tissue and looked exactly like normal humans. Nevertheless, every time the Terminatrix is on screen, it's hard not to picture Mostow just off-camera saying, ""Do it again, and this time, try to act more like a machine!"" Wasn't the whole point of the newer and better Terminators to look and act more like humans and not like machines? At any rate, it just comes off as over-acting here. But still, like the new Indiana Jones movie, the entertainment level is high, and there are certainly some good moments, like the Terminator telling John, ""Desire is irrelevant. I am a machine!"" I have a feeling that part 3 is going to be a low point in the series, which I'm not sure when it will end. I am thrilled to know that Christian Bale will take on the role of John Connor in Terminator: Salvation. It looks like the series is heading in exciting new directions",0.0

296,"Truly A Masterpiece of a Film, and the True Work of a Master; Pulp Fiction is a film that cannot be described in mere words. To put it simply, Pulp Fiction is a Masterpiece. Had it not gone up against Forrest Gump in the 1994 Oscars, it would have won so many more awards! Pulp Fiction is my all time favorite movie, and I'll tell you why: 1. The acting is superb. John Travolta revitalized his career with this single motion picture, and truly made a name for himself as an actor. He once would settle for 40,000 a film, but now commands several million. Samuel L. Jackson was possibly the most intense person in Pulp Fiction, and deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor that was wrongfully given away. His final scene in the movie always sends a chill down my spine whenever I watch it. 2. The Screenplay was incredible. Quentin Tarantino and Roger Averys screenplay for Pulp Fiction won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and it deserved it. If you watch the movie, you know that it is a long movie (2.5 hours to be exact) but Tarantinos use of dialouge in the movie keeps the action moving, and it also keeps the viewer interested. No part of the movie is slow paced, and the plot twists and subtleties are incredible. 3. The Cinematography was terrific. Tarantinos use of the camera in Pulp Fiction was just perfect. As many Tarantino fans know, Tarantino got his start working in a Video Rental store. It was there, that he got the chance to view several different formats of filming, and he was able to combine them in his films to create a feeling of involvement with what happens on the screen. 4. And finally, the Music choices were fantastic. For those who have seen Pulp Fiction, you will know about the Guitar Riff at the beginning of the movie that plays during the credits. It is called Misirlou, and was written by Dick Dale and his Del Tones. Misirlou was around 32 years before Pulp Fiction, and will forever be known as ""The Theme From Pulp Fiction"". Tarantino takes old songs and puts them in his films, thereby reintroducing these old songs to a new generation of listeners. Tarantino stamps each of his scenes with a specific song, and the people who watch the movie will associate it with that particular scene. Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest films in creation, and it is a true classic. It is my belief that people will come to appreciate it more with age, just like a fine wine.",0.0
2571,"This movie is one of the greatest.; This is one of the greatest movie's of all time.. At least the 1st one. The rest of the trilogy was still good because it was an entire story. I feel like the 1st Matrix was just so eye opening. The way the writer described the world makes it believe that we are truly living in a Matrix. Since this movie came out I feel like the world has slowly opened their eyes to this idea of an alternate reality. There is no one else that could have played Neo but Mr. Reeve's.. He was talked bad upon because of the way he acts but that's him. If Will Smith would have locked down the role of Neo I don't think I would have liked the movie the same. Morpheus was such a big role for anyone to play. He is the reason why the Matrix exists. Without him finding it and trying to find the one, everyone in the world stays asleep.. I also feel like we are in a Matrix and wish Morpheus would call me to give me a pill. Favorite line from the movie... "" Yeah everyday, it's called mescaline."" I don't know how you can follow up the second and third movie after the first Matrix. It was just so good. The second Matrix ""Reloaded"", had those awesome ghosts. That chases scene on the high way saved the movie for me as far as hype. But the Matrix is the Matrix and you can never take that image of Neo waking up the black screen with the green writing out of your mind. It's burned in there. Thank you for the Matrix. I still watch it till this day all the way through and learn something new.",0.0

People are talking about a second level of humor; I couldn't find the first! The level of ""humor"" here is below rock bottom. Animal House & Porkies is miles above the level of ""humor"" in this piece of crap. I can't believe I spent $20 for this!

2571,"What is real and what is imagined; I saw ""The Matrix"" on opening day and again three days later.  Any good movie, especially one as complex in message, plot and visuals, should be viewed more than once. I was intrigued by the previews for this film the first time I saw them. They filled me with a lot of questions, mainly, what in the world is this about?  All of my questions were answered. ""The Matrix"" is one wild ride that makes a person question what is real and what is the intangible construct of our imagination.  How much of what we see and experience is the truth, and how much is only our perception of the data we are bombarded by and required to process every day? The script was beautifully constructed, the dialog just what was necessary to relay plot and character.  The performances were a joy to watch, easily allowing the viewer to suspend disbelief.  The baddies were spooky, evocative of the mysterious men in black characters traveling in threes that people into government/alien conspiracy claim really do exist in our world. The music was so well applied that I barely noticed it (as great soundtracks should be) as it wove its way though the visuals, underscoring the mood. I was floored when Mr. Smith (a baddie) commented about humans not fitting into their environment, being a cancer on the planet.  I've believed this for years.  Did the writers of this movie read my mind? And, how could I not comment specifically on Keanu Reeves' performance. I've enjoyed his work for quite some time.  In this movie, as in others, he is excellent at playing confused, misplaced and, in the end, victorious characters.  As Neo he struggles well with accepting his reality and his place in the scheme of things.  I'd give his performance in this, on a scale of one to ten (10 being the best), about an 8 1/2. Lawrence Fishburn was enthralling as the rather somber, patient, nurturing mentor, Morpheus.  Carrie-Anne Moss was wonderful as Trinity.  The rest of the supporting cast rounded out the film with style. ""The Matrix"" reminded me of other films I enjoyed: ""Johnny Mnemonic"" (in which the main character was also 'plugged-in') and ""Dark City"". I truly enjoyed this movie, and when it's available on video I'll add it to my very selective collection of special movies to enjoy over and over. What is real and what is imagined?  Maybe this review only exists in my mind.  Maybe this movie is only a construct of my warped fantasies.  If that's the case, I invite you in to share it.",0.0
2571,"Ted Logan knows kung fu?; When Ted, sorry, NEO, and Morpheus sit down in a white backdrop and Fishburne asks, ""What is the 'Matrix,' you have undoubtedly witnessed one of the worst scenes ever in cinematic history. THE MATRIX is very betraying unto itself, for what good is kung fu if it is not blended in with what also has made the BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER television series so great? THE MATRIX needed kung fu and sex to blend in with what already was boring. The special effects and Hugo Weaving are great, but everything else lacks. What is the Matrix? A computer hacker is about to find out the hard way. Bad, bad, bad acting, almost as terrible as BLADE RUNNER. What a waste of special effects, though, since the camera trick was very revolutionary for its time. Oh well. Science fiction deserves better than THE MATRIX, for an entire movie with guns and kung fu should have been far more fun than becoming downright serious in its lunacy. Boring.",0.0
48385,"US-and-A ------- Light, Unique, and Hilarious; Before I watched 'Borat: Cultural Learning of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' (I don't know why the title is so damned long), I expected it'll be similar to his previous movie as Ali G. It however turned up to be very enjoyable and exceeding my expectation. I could feel that the audiences were also enjoying the ride and picking up all the jokes easily. When the movie started, I was rather worried as I saw its format. It is using a classic-film format, in which you normally find on the 70's movies. Surprisingly enough, I was wrong again as the format itself became a really good selling-point. Together with the comedy itself, Borat has occupied my mind for few days - trying to figure out how could a person have those ideas. Simply put, this is a unique movie offering a different perspective to the audiences. Story-wise, you shouldn't expect too much as well as the usual aspects from a movie (e.g. sound or graphic effect), but if you'd like a one-and-a-half hour non-stop good laugh, this is the perfect course for you. The story line goes as following: Suggested by the title, Borat is the representative of Kazakhstan with a mission to learn any cultural aspects of America where they are to be implemented in Kazakhstan. The movie therefore covers Borat's journey in learning the American culture while chasing his first-sight love - Pamela Anderson.",0.0
296,"I may have to just get used to Tarantino before I like this movie as much as others; I just figured before a couple of days ago I have never seen a Tarantino movie. So on a whim I decided to watch this without really knowing too much about the way he makes movies. All I knew aside from it's critical reputation is that it wasn't linear and it's ultra-violent. The movie is 4 stories with connecting characters and the theme of crime all throughout. I'd say there are memorable scenes in each story (such as the introductory scene to one of them with Christopher Walken, that was the perfect blend of leaving an impact in mere minutes with a perfect blend of awkward writing with the most awkward mainstream actor ever) and they do have nods such as the violence is something I'd see out of a Hong Kong action movie around the same time, the structure is very... French New Wave and the writing is clever enough to write dialogue pointless to the plot (or... almost everything really) but establishes character. If anything I don't like the comedy, I know it's meant to be black comedy but I never really laughed, I also find the establishing character dialogue to just be done a little too much in this movie. While I enjoyed it, and I hope nobody goes nuts - I didn't really enjoy it as much as others have.",0.0
8874,"Yawn of the Dead; ** SPOILERS ** Before I start with the review I'd like to make clear that I am a huge fan of anything that has anything to do with zombie films. I see all I can get my hands on, whether they get good or bad reviews and whether I've heard anything about them or not. Shan of the Dead seemed like a cool idea for a movie, at least prior to when I saw the trailer. After seeing the trailer I thought I'd give it a chance anyway. Something not recommended to others, since that's those 99 minutes of your life that you're never going to get back. One of the main problems with this movie is the characters. For good drama you need suitable characters to move the story forward. Shaun of the Dead lacks this vital component. In many instances it's hard to tell what the screenwriter was thinking. The following characters inherit this film: The main character Shaun. He is an ugly loser with nothing going for him. He feels sorry for himself the whole film through all the way to the ending, but it's really his own fault that he is a big loser. Shaun has a friend who lives off him and Shaun's other roommate. This guy is a lazy, fat and disgusting slob with no sense of responsibility whatsoever. I forgot to mention that he deals marijuana as his only way of income. Adorable, isn't it? Shaun's second roommate has a job (!!), a sense of responsibility and seems to know what's right or wrong. Constantly throughout the short period of time that this character still survives, he is being called names behind his back by his ""friends"", and he is the one who dies first. Hold up a second here. Something's wrong. The unsympathetic main characters are morons who nobody can identify with, and the only sensible person in the trio gets killed off quickly. You can't build a movie like this. If you can't identify yourself with the protagonists, you won't care what happens to this and then the movie will not draw you in. I won't bore you with descriptions the rest of the characters, but it's basically the same drill as with the ones I've already mentioned. Another problem with the film is that it's a bit schizophrenic in the sense that it doesn't know what kind of movie it wants to be. It certainly is no romantic comedy, because 1. Let's face it: How romantic are zombies, really? and 2. It's a failed attempt at comedy since very few jokes actually are funny. Maybe the last one is because it's a British sort of humor that I don't 'get'. Anyway, the up until the last 20 minutes, the movie tries to be a comedy, then however it gets 100 percent serious and turns into some sort of splatter-horror-drama. This film is not a good film, and it's one of the worst zombie films I've seen and I've seen some pretty bad ones.",0.0
6537,"""Not A Bad Sequel!""; Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes and Kristanna Loken star in this 2003 sci-fi sequel.

6537,"Should have stopped after T-2; To be fair, this was not a bad movie. It was a decent movie. But it is nowhere near as good as T1 and T2 and it untied what I thought was a very good, clean, well tied-off ending to T2. They made two good movies that told a good story and had a near-perfect ending and they should have left it alone. But, Hollywood is all about making money, and for a few million dollars they were willing to undo that ending and create a new one that was rather unsatisfying and makes you look back with skepticism on the efforts of the futuristic characters of the first two movies. I really wish they'd just left it alone after T2 and never made this one.",0.0
8874,"Who would've thought that a movie could be so funny while, at the same time, making you cower in fear?; Every morning, with our lives in a rut, we all wake up and go about some sort of an interminable daily routine. Showering, eating breakfast, going to work; it's all part of some chronic, tedious spiel. Eventually, we all become mindless zombies; following our habitual lives without even the slightest thought. The question is, what exactly would we do if our incessant worlds were turned upside-down? If for once, something different occurred? Well, according to Edgar Wright's Shaun Of The Dead, the answer to that question is simple; we'd laugh about it. While poking fun at the British culture, and the faults of many perfunctory societies, Shaun Of The Dead acts as a campy English take on the recently stupefied horror genre. It starts out slow; setting the grounds for it's multi-layered characters and plot, then jests its way into an elongated, and quite riveting climax. The movie follows the story of an oblivious slacker named Shaun {Simon Pegg} who's life falls apart when his girlfriend, Liz {Kate Ashfield}, dumps him due to his indolent nature. The next day, Shaun, and his half-witted best friend, Ed {Nick Frost}, awaken to find the world overrun by the cannibalistic undead. From here on out, the plot becomes an amusing, and largely witty piece of comedic satire as our heroes struggle to save Liz, her uptight roommates, and Shaun's mother, then reach a nearby pub where they plan to take refuge, and hopefully survive the night. Unlike in most horror films where cardboard cutout characters run around getting chopped to pieces, survival and suspense in Shaun Of The Dead actually takes a backseat to character development, and, well, romance as Shaun uses the apocalypse to his advantage, and tries to win back Liz's heart. Heck, the movie's tag-line is even ""a romantic comedy, with zombies."" Don't get me wrong though; even with its many affectionate, and comedic moments, Shaun Of The Dead also packs enough scares to get any horror fan excited. The balance between comedy and horror in this film is virtually flawless, acting largely as the movie's greatest achievement. For example, during the last half-hour of this film, in which hoards of the undead finally invade our heroes' sanctuary {a pub}, initiating an action packed end-all battle for survival, people are impaled, ripped apart, and eaten as a jukebox plays quirky pop music, and ironically important fart jokes pop up into the atmosphere. One second you'll be smiling, and the next; your eyes will be scrunched closed in fear and disgust. Shaun Of The Dead is also very successful in it's constant mocking of the drudgingly humdrum aspects of society. Initially taunting only the British culture {it is a British film after all}, the movie ends up making fun of anyone, and everyone who can connect with the idea of being in a rut. One scene in particular that emphasizes this point, and actually defines the tone of the movie as a whole, would be one in which Shaun wakes up, goes outside, walks to a local convenient store for breakfast, and goes back to his house, all without realizing that the city of London is up in chaos as hundreds of corpses and moaning, flesh-hungry zombies line the bloody streets. Obliviousness and laziness; these two things make society as a whole almost indistinguishable from the living dead. All in all, Shaun Of The Dead is a smart, scary, hilarious, and horrifyingly witty satire that constantly teases the everyday lives of people across the globe. After reading this review, I suggest that you go out, find a cricket bat {or any blunt object for that matter}, get to a theater, and see this movie. Oh yeah, and one more thingÂ…Aim for their heads.

48385,"My name a Borat...who the hell cares; Was this supposed to be funny? I sat there and watched this movie with my friends, it was a normal, quiet evening. Then I realized....it was QUIET! Where were the laughs? There were none to be had! I was sitting there for literally an hour wondering ""when does the comedy start?"" All I heard were the same jokes used over and over and over and over, and they weren't even funny the first time. First off, this movie's racism is sad. They make it look like Kazakhstan is a poor, dirty country with absolutely no common sense in the outside world whatsoever. Borat himself is a complete and total moron. That doesn't mean the whole country is. Also, his wife, I think she was the best character there. All he does is bad mouth her, while she actually does work. Then she tells him not to cheat on her, and once he gets to America, the poor woman dies so he goes after Pam Anderson. What an idiot. Then there were the awful gay and Jewish jokes. The gay jokes were just lame, and the whole naked fight scene with his partner was just stupid. The Jewish jokes were by far the worst. All he did was make fun of Jewish people. If I recall correctly, Kazakhstan's 2nd main religion is Judaism. Why did they even bother trying to estimate what Kazakhstanians are like? They failed miserably. The Bed & Breakfast scene made me mad. That wasn't funny at all, those people were nice to Borat and all he did was make fun of them then run out in the middle of the night. I would have chased him down and shot him in the face. Over all, don't even bother with this movie.

What I shall say is this--HP:CoS is basically a darker, more forward version of the first installment. Which is a pretty good thing because I found this film to be fairly intricate and twisting (FYI, I have NEVER read the novels)--far moreso than Sorceror's Stone. A couple things that I would change would first to feature Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) in more scenes--I don't know why, but he adds so much to the table and creates an excellent foil for he other actors. I would also cut back on that 2002 version of Jar-Jar Binks, Dobby the House elf--not entirely, because its role is rather important but by a bit so that it remains a novelty of S&M rather than a drain on the senses.

The basic premise may be nothing new (a friend of mine wrote a sf short story with a nearly identical premise when he was in high school!), but it's treated with such inventiveness and style that it seems compelling and fresh.

6537,"Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"" Rises To New Levels; The film picks up a number of years after the last feature as we see John Connor (Stahl), future leader and Saviour of the human race, in his mid twenties (I'd guess), living 'off the grid' since the events from the last film (if you haven't seen the previous two films I don't know what the heck you're doing here, but whatever...). Turns out 'judgment day' was not averted, as initially thought at the end of the 2nd film, but only postponed, as Skynet is around in some form, as indicated by the arrival of a Terminator robot, a model T-X played by Loken. It seems now the future is populated by really hot and sexy blonde robots with definite feminine characteristics...homina, homina...soon after we see another Terminator arrive, the muscled one we're more accustomed to, played by Arnold. Seems the T-X model, or Terminatrix Bot has been sent back to target Connor, but if it can't get to him, it's supposed to go after those who would be his lieutenants, including that of Kate Brewster (Danes), whose father, played by Andrews, just happens to be some military bigwig in charge of the program which will eventually become Skynet, the artificial intelligence that will eventually take over the world, exterminating the human threat. Make sense? Probably not...anyway, given this new threat, someone from within the resistance from the future decided to send back an Arnold robot to protect whomever needed protecting, but its task a difficult one given the sophistication of the T-X model, which is essentially an enhanced logic weapons systems cybernetic combat infiltration unit with nanotechnological transjectors inside a titanium battle chassis surrounded by a mimetic poly alloy...whew! So what does all that mean? Well, it can manipulate machines under computer control, tap into communications systems, and produce weaponry from within, including a wicked plasma cannon from its arm, among other things. Things aren't looking so good for John (or the human race, for that matter), but did I mention the Terminatrix is really hot? Given the fact Terminator 2 made as much as it did at the box office, I'm not surprised someone decided to continue on with the franchise, despite the fact the story had been pretty much wrapped up at the end of the second film. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines does try to fit itself within the continuity of the previous two films, and, on the surface it succeeds, but once you start picking at the loose threads, there are inconsistencies (then again, when we're talking about time travel, who's to say what could and couldn't happen?). Now, I'm not going to go through and relate all the bits I thought out of place as I'm sure many have already done so, and done so a lot better than I could have, but I will say if you take this movie at face value (a straight up action film), you'll probably have a lot more fun. There was one bit that really bothered me, though, and that was when John, Kate, and the Arnold Bot were trying to contact Kate's father, who just happened to be secured away in some top-secret military installation. One minute they're driving towards the place and the next they're inside, talking to Kate's father...I suppose the Arnold Bot could have bypassed the security somehow, but it all seemed rather convenient, especially given the circumstances. I did like the whole bit about a widespread virus running through the Internet, where it came from, and its ultimate purpose. The characters in this film seemed to take a backseat to the action, as none are really developed as much as they were in the previous films. Perhaps the filmmakers were relying on the character development already out there from the earlier films, but given so few characters carried over, this didn't work out so well. One of the biggest weaknesses in the film, in my opinion, was that of Stahl's character of John Connor. There seemed to be an awful lot of inconsistencies indicating perhaps this wasn't the same John Connor as was in the previous movie. I'm not a big fan of Stahl (he reminds me too much of Giovanni Ribisi, whom I care even less for), but I thought he did pretty well in the film Sin City (2005). As far as Danes, well, she looked good, but her performance was limited by her role, as it was written. While the plot and the characters may have been half-baked, at least the action was balls out. My favourite bit involved a car chase sequence featuring a gigantic crane truck barreling through city streets, causing massive amounts of destruction. Another great bit was when the two Terminators were fighting each other within the military base, and the Arnold Bot uses a urinal as an offensive weapon. The first time I saw this film and the ending was presented I found myself saying ""What the f***?"", but, after watching it again last night it did seem to make sense in terms of the story presented. All in all I thought this a great action film, but in terms of a sequel to the Terminator series, it was so-so...I'd agree with Cameron that there really wasn't anything left to tell in the story, but if there's a chance to make money, you know Hollywood will capitalize.",0.0

The first half is merely dull and boring.Then it becomes ugly, gross, vicious and disgusting. It ends up being forgettable and sickening.

6537,"The Sequel That Is Action, And Not Much Else; I have always been a fan of the Terminator movies, and when I first heard they were doing a third, I couldn't help but be disappointed. Strike One. Then the news hit me that James Cameron opted out on this movie. Strike Two. Then I actually saw the movie. Strike three, Hollywood sucks! First, there is almost no resemblance between T3 and its predecessors, plot wise. Here there is enough plot to satisfy your typical big-budget summer movie. Yet there were enough continuity and plot holes that I felt empty myself. I've had bowel movements more satisfying than the plot of this movie, which absolutely destroys the beauty of ""There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."" But for the masses, this is the movie of the summer. It's all action and forced humor. The entrance of Arnold was not entertaining, nor was him using ""Talk to the hand."" Ick... Acting...well, it wasn't as bad as ""Battlefield Earth"" but it wasn't good either. Kristianna Loken is a pretty face, and she is nowhere near as frightening and creepy as Robert Patrick. But he also had a score that made him creepy. Arnold is back to what he did well once, but that is no longer there. Here, he tries to channel the Arnold of T2, and fails. Nick Stahl wasn't a bad choice, and continuity wise, I'm glad they chose him instead of Edward Furlong. Furlong just doesn't have the charisma or brooding sense that Nick Stahl brought to John Connor's role. Claire Danes, forgettable, just like the minor characters that pop up here and there. The humor...wasn't funny. Trying to make Arnold into a comedian is nearly as bad as making Gimli a comedian. It doesn't fit, it isn't funny, and most of all, it made me want to vomit. The action is where this movie shines, and that's it. The car chase is phenominal. The fights between the TX and the T800, uh, T101...??? (it was T-800, Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 in the previous films) are very cool. All in all, the action makes this movie. For being an all-round disappointment for me, it was entertaining. But now my dwindling faith in Hollywood has vanished. No more lacklustre sequels with no plot and all action. 6.5 out of 10",0.0

8874,"Intelligent Mix of Genres; Anno 2004: talented director Edgar Wright already proved himself rock solid, having made ""Spaced"": a hilarious TV show that never got the success it deserved and ran from the (very) late 90's to 2001, starring most of the same actors you'll see in ""Shaun of the Dead"". But enough back story: the question awaiting the release of this movie was of course if Wright had enough going for himself to provide the wit his TV-series had for the length of a full-feature film. And he sure did. Shaun (an insanely sarcastic Simon Pegg) and Ed, two immediately likable slackers who also happen to be best friends, live together in a house they rent, find themselves face to face with a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus, right after Shaun's girlfriend broke up with him. Long story short: Shaun's sole target is to get the girl and save his friends and family, while still maintaining his charming sense of humour. I could ramble on and on about how much I love this movie for all it has going for it, but you'll just have to discover for yourself.

296,"Possibly a perfect film.; Pulp Fiction is one of my favorite films. I've seen this movie at least a dozen times, but I'm yet to get tired of it. This masterpiece is fast paced, action pact and extremely quotable. Many people consider Pulp Fiction to be Quentin Tarantino's magnum opus. The editing is interesting in that the film is told out of order and the audience has to see it more than once before they can start piecing it together. The directing is fantastic, as per usual with Tarantino. Further following an early Tarantino trend, he casts himself in a small role and as usual, it a terrible actor. Don't let Tarantino's poor acting deter you, the rest of the cast is amazing. Pulp Fiction is thought to be the film that brought back John Travolta's career, but there is much more than that. Nearly the entire cast are legendary actors. Furthering the Tarantino tradition, ""Pulp Fiction"" has an amazing soundtrack. There is nothing bad that I can say about this film. It is honestly the closest thing to film perfection that I can think of.",0.0
2571,"Hard to be original....; Now that we have had the pioneering-stages of film-making, and passed through the first stages of computer-animation and graphics creating the illusion of another world within the one we live in, life and movies could have become exciting. But in fact the results are pretty disappointing. Hollywood bores us almost to death with re-makes and re-makes of re-makes and the results are almost consistently worse than the originals which at least, but certainly not only, had the profits of being original. This case isn't much different. The producers should be given credit in creating a fantasy and doing it convincingly, as well as doing a good job on dealing with some of the special effects and stunts. Fighting scenes are not too bad either, but lack involvement, and could very rarely be called exciting. This makes the Matrix certainly not a thriller or good action movie. In this way the Matrix is disappointing due to a weak plot, a badly told story that suffers from a lack of story-telling abilities, involvement, surprise and continuity. This movie could make a nice prequel to a series, but a lot needs to be done to really make this a success: better and deeper characters, a good story-line, a more realistic view of mankind, better directing and more involvement with characters and less attention drawn on special effects could make the sequels a good start for a new kind of sci-fi movies. The cast seems good enough, and should not be blamed for the way the story evolves in this movie; one only gets the idea, certainly after having seen the extras on the dvd and 'the making of'-documentary the attention of the directors and producers was drawn almost totally towards the 'Kung-fu' and special effects this way creating a life-like comic-book sci-fi movie. Some involvement of George Lucas could do a lot of good to this movie, even if only consulting him on creating and telling stories. But he certainly would not have been proud of this movie if the result would be this disappointing on so many points. Referring to the beginning of this comment, the Matrix is hugely overrated, but over-looking the releases of the last few years this should not be a surprise... people are not exactly spoiled with good movies, and if trying to be original could be rewarded, this movie should earn an award for maybe a not fully successful, but at least one of the most successful attempts to be original of the last few years. Maybe only exceeded by the largely underrated 'Dark City'.",0.0
71057,"Why is 6 afraid of 7? Because 7 8 9.; I seriously can't believe Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov, two people I LOVE, signed on to produce this crap. Tim Burton is a brilliant director, but to be honest I've been losing interest in him for a while since his last few movies were either remakes or adaptations. He did produce the brilliant ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", which is one I've watched multiple times, and directed movies like ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"", which are awesome films. Bekmambetov directed 3 films that I LOVE: Night Watch, Day Watch, and Wanted. I've only seen those three of his, but they prove he's an awesome director. Those two people producing one of the many reasons I was excited to see 9. So today I went to go see it at the theatre. I was so excited to finally have seen it. I had waited 7 months for the movie to come out. This movie is the first time I've walked out of a Tim Burton-related movie and said ""I enjoyed almost NONE of that"". I felt heartbroken to even have felt that way. I mean, with him and Bekmambetov at the production helm you'd have expected this movie to be a good watch. Right now I still can't get over how let down I was by this movie. I hadn't even heard of the original short film before seeing it but now, I can successfully say that this movie should have remained a short movie. Hell, Neil Blomkamp made an AWESOME full length remake of Alive in Joburg entitled District 9, what was so hard to get right about 9??? I really wanted to think this movie was awesome. I really did. But no, it failed on so many levels. The plot was extremely confusing and disjointed. I had no idea what was going on, let alone what it was about. Basically it's about a bunch of rag doll robots trying to save the earth. Well, OK, that's what I got from it. But the writing here is extremely poor. The whole film jumps around like a 6 year old with A.D.D. telling a story. There's this big, giant clanky monster robot that 9 awakens, causing destruction and stuff. That's the main villain. However, what else is wrong with this movie is that EVERYTHING COMES OUT OF NOWHERE. There were too many monster robots, most of which have no logical explanation behind them. They have 0 development whatsoever. I mean, that flying pterodactyl like monster just rips out of nowhere, we have no idea where it comes out of and Acker just expects us to know what it is. What was even more retarded was that snake-like creature with the strobing eyes that hypnotize. I dare you to give that description to someone else out loud and expect them not to laugh. All of the 3 people I told about it burst out laughing. Oh and it wraps victims up and sews them inside it. I'M. NOT. KIDDING. The twist in Act III is the most retarded aspect of the whole movie. So basically 9 goes back to the room he woke up in, finds this box with a hologram from the scientist in it for 9, and he tells him that the big scary machine robot was designed to bring robot life to earth, but then evil humans use it for war, and it was supposed to help protect the earth, but then the scientist gave his life to 9 so that it could help protect the world with it. And HE ONLY MENTIONS GIVING HIS LIFE TO 9. But what about the other robots? WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES TO THEM???????? This is the perfect example of poor, rushed writing. There's only one of the life taking device thingy that exists so how did the other 8 get life given to them??????? The characters are not likable at all either. They risk their lives for no reason at all. The only good character is 7. 6 annoyed me with his ""GO BACK TO THE SOURCE!!!!!!"" ramblings, 1 is an overpowering idiot, 2 we don't know ANYTHING about, 5 kept annoying me with his ""Are you sure..."" or ""Can I stay here instead...?"" questions. And that ending? UGH. I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks that the ending was a huge WTF moment. There's nothing redeeming about this turd except for its beautiful animation. Everything looks realistic and beautiful, I love the gloomy and depressing look of everything. However, beauty can't save a good movie. While it's true that this movie is very pretty looking, pretty is as pretty does, and 9 does squat. I'm sure Burton fans will be flocking to the theatre to see this movie without a doubt, in fact with his and Bekmambetov's names being thrown around the promos, people will be flocking to the theatre to see this movie. I know I may be making a big deal out of nothing, but watching this movie made me realize how much I hate movies with unlikeable characters, nonexistent plot and just pure style over content.

296,"A Classic Masterpiece; This is the film that redefined movies in general. With a great script, actors and actresses that really gives their best performance, and a masterful director to finish, Pulp Fiction is a classic masterpiece that I dare say beats any other movie masterpieces the world known. Pulp Fiction is a crime movie that is in love with dialogue. And the dialogue ranges from a simple random chat to an argument about miracles. Quentin Tarantino seems to just put in everything he can think of while writing this script, and I have to say, it worked. You will find yourself repeating the lines that are said in this movie long after the end credits rolled. Although this isn't a comedy movie, Pulp Fiction always delivers scenes after scenes that are absurd, ridiculous, and at times roaringly hilarious. A scene in the car near the end of the movie had me rolling on the floor because it was so damned funny. There are some other scenes that had me rolling on the floor too but I'll let you watch the movie yourself to see which ones are they. Yes, this is one of those movies that you can just watch over and over again and never get bored of watching. Loads of reasons why, not to mention the great script, great acting, great music, and the fantastic effort from the now well-known Quentin Tarantino. I must've watched it over a 100 times and I have never been bored of watching it. So, why don't you go do yourself a favour and go watch this movie if you haven't already.

48385,"The Howard Stern Syndrome; It's really a shame that most of America will never realize what a comic genius Howard Stern was (and may still be). From about 1984 to 1988 Stern was the funniest man in America. From that point on he spiraled down, caught up in a self-destructive obsession with garbage and pushing the envelope on common decency. Plus Howard just got lazy. I see a little of the same phenomenon with Cohen. There's no disputing that portions of this movie are very inspired & outrageously funny. But Cohen goes over the decency line so many times it eventually became unwatchable. I have other problems with this movie - are we supposed to believe the other ""actors"" think this is a valid documentary? If they're not in on the joke it all seems pretty mean-spirited and makes me uncomfortable. If they're in on the joke then what's the point? I understand that ""tasteless"" in itself has its own mindless, Wet Hot American Summer market, but this is one movie I think might have benefited from some responsible studio oversight.",0.0
296,"Worth the hype; Quentin Tarantino's gallery of grotesques is definitely a strange film to watch. Breaking many of the modern rules of a film - there are four interlocking stories instead of one, the subject matters tackled are extremely adult and may not be to everybody's taste - it's a wonder that the film succeeds, but in the end PULP FICTION has to be one of the best films of the 1990s. As much as we would like to ignore it, this is what the world is like today, full of drugs, violence and hostility, and it's about time a film faced up to the real world. PULP FICTION does just this. I liked three of the stories, but the one involving Travolta and Thurman left me cold I'm afraid. For a start, it's far too long and needlessly talky (about nothing in particular), and could have been cut down a lot. It seems to take ages to get to the actual horror of the piece (Thurman's drug overdose and subsequent heart injection), and when that moment comes, it's over extremely quickly. There is no particularly memorable dialogue here, either. The surrounding story, where the couple hold up a restaurant, is perfectly set up, and the final moments, where Jackson holds up the robbers himself, does show some of Tarantino's genius as Jackson quietly discusses the situation with his would-be robbers in a matter-of-fact way. The story of Travolta and Jackson trying to clear up their 'mess' is an excellent piece of black comedy, well-timed and with a scene-stealing performance from Harvey Keitel as the Wolf. Bruce Willis' story is very good too, with some unexpected twists in the tale and some harrowing scenes. There's a catchy jukebox score and an ensemble cast to liven things up too. The cast list is a reading of '90s talent: John Travolta in his comeback film; Samuel L Jackson was relatively unheard-of then; Uma Thurman proved herself as a woman to be reckoned with; Bruce Willis lent another world-weary performance to his CV, and none the worse for it; Ving Rhames also proved himself as an up-and-coming actor; Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer were cool and hysterical in equal measures; Harvey Keitel stole the show as clear-up man; Quentin Tarantino put in a twitchy cameo appearance which wasn't as nearly as bad as everybody said; Eric Stoltz was memorable as a stoned drug addict...the list is endless, really. There are other names I miss out in the interests of space. While Tarantino's rapid-fire dialogue is as sharp as ever (his decision to have the hit men talk about normal, everyday things like Quarter Pounders and Big Macs instead of ""gangster stuff"" was very clever), it is the succession of odd images which really stay in the mind, such as Travolta accidentally blowing apart someone's head; Willis and Rhames fighting, escaping into a spare-part shop and getting attacked; Thurman's adrenaline injection and the hysteria surrounding it; and finally Roth and Plummer getting the tables turned on them. All of these moments help to make PULP FICTION an endearing slice of cinema, which I'm sure will be remembered as a minor classic in years to come.",0.0

It is awfully hard to believe that the participants in this movie were not aware of the presence of cameras and cameramen and/or camerawomen. How much of it was scripted? Also, is a release not required to show the people Borat is interacting with on film? Why would some of these people sign a release if what they said on film cast them in a bad light? Do they not realize what they sound like? Did they sign a release beforehand? Then how could they be unaware of what was going on?

8874,"Best Film of 2004; Shaun of the Dead was simply one of the best films of 2004 and one of the best zombie films ever to be put to celluloid. Everything in the movies works. The acting is top notch without relying on any big Hollywood heavyweights (well, at least not big names to us uncultured American swine). The special effects/make up were great too, all the zombies look pretty convincing (not that I've had the misfortune of ever meeting a real zombie). Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's script is what really carries the film. The cyclical nature of the dialogue, the subtle references to other films, and the flat out funny moments elevate this movie from a standard zombie film to a movie unique among its genre. The overall running length of the film (about 100 minutes) is essentially faultless; the film is long enough to tell a complete, logically flowing, self-contained story but short enough to never drag. Wright's discreet direction adds another dimension to the film; with everyone minor character or event returning or being referenced at one point another. Shaun of the Dead also doesn't lose appeal in repeated viewings; if anything it strengthens the movie. A small detail, for example Ed's phone call in the first scene at Shaun, Pete, and Ed's house and the conversation the kid has on his phone at Shaun's work place, could be overlooked quite easily the first time around. Shaun of the Dead became an instant cult-classic in the states upon its limited release in theaters, and will probably stay that way, but deservedly so. While I haven't found anyone I know personally who dislikes the movie, its understandable why it didn't have major box-office appeal (British film satirizing/making a homage to a particular niche of the movie-going audience isn't exactly financial gold). Overall, if you like comedy and like zombies see this movie now, even if you've seen it, see it again.",0.0

I like my food lean mean with plenty of GREEN(the Hulk is a healthy film) Its high time people stopped eating pigs manure, you need to be able to tell the difference between a healthy film and an unhealthy one, its like the difference between having terminal lung cancer and having fit and healthy lungs - if you can't make this distinction you better learn other wise you are doomed.

903,"Well Done Alfred you've done it again.; Vertigo is a 1958 psychological thriller directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The film features James Stewart, Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes. The film tells the story of a Vertigo sufferer and police detective, John Ferguson, who believes that his newly found girlfriend is a reincarnation of a possessed woman who he saw commit suicide in the San Francisco Bay, after being assigned to investigate what was wrong with her. Both women are portrayed by Novak. It was premiered in the San Sebastian International Film Festival on May 8, 1958, where it was received poorly, polarising both critics and commercial audiences. However, as the film aged, it has become one of the most recognised, acclaimed American films ever made. In 1989, Vertigo was recognised as a ""culturally, historically and aesthetically significant"" film by the National Film Registry and subsequently restored internationally in 1996.",0.0
71057,"Could have been the best animated film this year :-(; This movie could have really been the best animation this year :-/ I really do believe it! The animation and the general idea was a brilliant base for a very very touchy story. Not for kids, but that is not the point. The point is the story was not present. Usually I am mad to waste my time on a plot-less movies, but this time I am truly sad. I am really sad the creators did not work more (or at all) on the plot and script. That really killed it for the movie. There is nothing more to say. Perfect animation (for the environment), perfect characters build up, perfect scenery, perfect time, perfect idea, but all the perfects were degraded to average by the absence of a mindful storyline :-( I honestly do believe that the audience is not even close that stupid, yet being served things like this plot. I don't understand why... just why... :-( I am giving it 6/10 because I consider the plot greatly important. I am really sad about it :-(",0.0

Fishburne spends half the movie saying, ""The Matrix"" is this, ""The Matrix"" is that, when he should have just gotten to the point that ""The Matrix"" is virtual reality.

296,"This Could Be The Greatest Movie Ever Made; I think that Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is not just a great movie, but quite possibly the greatest movie ever made. It has everything that a movie-goer would love to see in a movie. A great script full of plenty of gross-out moments, shocking moments, humor, great lines, and parts that make a watcher think. The film does not treat the audience like a moron like so many recent films have the tendency to do. It leaves you on the edge of your seat and you have to have an IQ that is larger than your shoe size to fully understand it. Tarantino also use time as a plot driving device in the most effective way I have ever seen put to film. I guess you could say that the film is in ""flashback"" form, but the characters and the plot that you see in those ""flashbacks"" make you forget that it has already happened! Along with the monster performances that Samuel L Jackson, John Travolta and Uma Thurman put on the table (not to mention the small, well acted part Quentin Tarantino did himself) makes this movie a 5 out of 4 star movie and an instant classic. Enjoy, it comes highly recommended by yours truly, Movieman02",0.0
48385,"Borat: Silly Movie-Going Experience for Make Entertainment of Audience; Borat, Borat, Borat. You will either love this movie, or you'll hate it, but chances are you'll love it. If you're easily offended, you're then likely going to hate it, but you most likely just want to see a funny movie. And Borat is the movie for you! The movie follows Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) as he travels to the US from Kazakhstan in order to learn lessons for his country and make a documentary. But when he discovers Baywatch on TV, and more importantly Pamela Anderson, he sets out on an epic quest from NY to California (where Pearl Harbor and Texas are). The humor is what happens along the way. He purchases an ice cream truck for the trip, accidentally enters a Jewish-owned Bed and Breakfast (Borat is anti-semetic), consequently holding a cross and his money close as he speaks fearfully into the camera of how the clever, shapeshifting Jews attempted to poison him, and later buys a grizzly bear for protection after the traumatic experience. He eventually reaches LA to meet his elusive Pamela Anderson, and funniness ensues--I won't go into further specifics. This is a great movie and an intelligent movie. Don't get turned off thinking it's just stupid humor or just making exploitative comments about Jews for cheap laughs; nay, it goes as far as making a few sly insinuations about our own culture, insinuations we can learn from. But, it is first and foremost a funny movie. The funniest of the year, though admittedly there have not been that many funny movies...

Fist of all, I thought that the characters in Home Alone were in no way apealing, second of all, Kevin is anoying. I was really surprised with this movie because one thing that makes it so wonderful is the characters. When you whatch the movies or read the books, you feel as though you're actually having the adventure with the characters, you feel as though, Harry, Hermoine and Ron are your friends. It's also surpising what a wonderful job Daniel Raddclif, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson do acting in this movie.

38038,"A really Grand Day Out Â– and A Close Ten!; I saw it at a German press screening. Without giving too much away: Most critics really seemed to like it very much. There was even applause afterwards, which is quite unusual for that species. From my point of view and until now, it was the funniest movie of the year. It keeps the charm and wit of the three W+G shorts and it is enlarged with many references to these and other movies. Of course, there are obvious allusions to monster- and werewolf-movies, especially to ""An American Werewolf in London"", ""Jaws"", ""King Kong"" and even to Peter Jackson's ""Braindead""/""Dead Alive"", but also to other genres. Characterization was better done in ""Chicken Run"", but that movie had a complete new ""cast"" where introduction was necessary. Here, you are already able to know the two main characters. So, the new ""Wallace and Gromit""-movie is enjoyed best if you watched (and liked) the shorts already, yet it also works on its own. ""Chicken Run"" had the more convenient, but also more ""storytelling"" plot. Instead, this new Aardman masterpiece keeps that crazier and somehow more ""isolated"" feeling of the W+G shorts. Children should also enjoy it very much, especially because of the sweet rabbits (if you love cute bunnies, this is a must-see for you!!!) and because Gromit has a lot do to and really steals the show (children also love dogs... :-) ). But many jokes are thought for a more adult audience (there are even soft sexual allusions in it). The movie manages, like ""Shrek 1+2"" and ""The Incredibles"", to fulfil high level entertainment for the whole family, with adding a British and at least a little bit darker edge to the humour of American animated movies. The animation is Â– as expected Â– superb, and they kept true to the Aardman style because they didn't put in too many digital effects - I realized just a few when it came to Wallace's inventions. Finally, the score works fine in the movie, although one of the main themes definitely is ""borrowed"" by Randy Edelman's ""Dragonheart"" score. The bad thing is: It will probably take another six years from now until we can see a new animated gem from Nick Park & Co.",1.0
1080,"history; Most of what can be said about Life of Brian already has been. It's the Pythons' tightest, funniest (all right, so that's subjective) and most thoughtful film. I watched Ben Hur the whole way through for the first time the other day, and the only thing that made it's turgid portents bearable was picturing Charlton Heston asking ""what have the Romans ever done for us?"" The big irony is that in spite of deliberately placing modern characters and attitudes into a historical setting for the sake of comedy, Life of Brian is in many ways the more historically sensitive film. Ben Hur is typical Hollywood history, turning the Judeans into proto-liberal nationalists on a quest for freedom from oppression every bit as anachronistic and spurious as that of Mel Gibson's William Wallace. At least Braveheart has only the single-whammy of glib, historically insensitive, self-congratulatory, judgemental retrospect. Ben Hur doubles its money by throwing in religious pomposity for that extra emotionally-manipulative kick. Life of Brian, on the other hand, despite forswearing any pretensions to historical accuracy, comes a lot nearer to providing a balanced historical perspective. What did the Romans ever do for us? Quite a lot, actually. Why are we resisting them? We're not quite sure. OK, so that's not particularly accurate either. The Jewish nation and subsequent diaspora is one of the pivotal test cases in any analysis of the concept of nationalism. Clearly, as the several major revolts demonstrate, there was real opposition to Roman rule, and it was proto-nationalist, insofar as any concepts of nation had by then developed. It's putting the heavily loaded - intrinsically modern - language of freedom into their mouths which is so offensive. It doesn't really need to be pointed out why Hollywood insists on doing this, but I'll do it anyway: it's a cheap way to cash in on the pride that every American is brought up to feel in the wonderful, mysterious accident of 1776. Someone else has already talked about Life of Brian's assault on selective history with regard to religion (still it's most powerful feature - I'm resolutely secular, but the level at which Christianity is ingrained into my culture is so fundamental that to conceive of the real-life figure of Jesus as just another bloke is still shocking). Life of Brian's common sense approach not only attacks this selectivity, it also lampoons retrospective history: the tendency to read one's own beliefs and priorities into people who viewed the world from an utterly different perspective and who, as the LP Hartley cliche has it, ""do things differently"". The People's Front of Judea are self-evidently ridiculous. But how can anyone have thought that Charlton Heston as Judea Ben Hur wasn't?",0.0

527,"Beautifully Crafted Masterpiece**Spoiler**; I just saw this film for the first time and I have never felt so touched by any other movie, and I'm only 15. It was so sad and heartbreaking when you see all the cruel things the Jews had to go through, but at the same time very uplifting when you see how far one man is willing to go to save these Jews. Especially when you see how he cries his heart out when he learns that he could have saved one more life by putting her name on the list (the maid/servant that Goethe liked, I think?) I had previously seen a few Holocaust movies, particularly liking The Pianist, but Schindler's List has much more of an emotional depth and impact on you when you watch it. For instance, when the two guards took away the old man with one arm, I knew he would be shot, but even when I saw it, I was still horrified as if I didn't know. To think that this really happened, and for so long, makes me believe that the only possible reason God allowed this to happen, is to show us good people how to defeat true evil and to make sure that it never happens again. I liked the color scheme, especially with the girl in the red coat. I saw her just almost waltzing through the liquidation, minding her own business, and the whole time I was thinking, ""How is she doing this? Is she even real? Or is she just a figment of Schindler's imagination meant to represent how the Jews will persevere through all this horror?"" I thought at first that Schindler looked like sorta a bad guy: how all he was concerned with was making money rather than saving lives. But after seeing all the burning bodies being carted out, he had the ever-important pang of conscience. The rest is history. I believe that Spielberg has created something that can never be matched in ours or any lifetime. I wish I could personally meet him and shake his hand and say, ""Thank you for making Schindler's List."" It's a real eye opener into human perseverance, be it in trying to survive (Jews) or in trying to save as many lives as possible (Schindler). This is one instance where the movie was FAR FAR better than the book, which I have read and will re-read. That 3 hours it took to witness flew right by for me, and I will be forever happy that I took those 3 hours to see it. Steven Spielberg will forever more be remembered for some of his other masterpieces like ""ET"" and ""Jaws"", but I will always remember him for Schindler's List.",0.0

8874,"Shaun of the Dead in Review; Of all the many horror film subjects, zombies are arguably the most popular. These resurrected, flesh-eating, stiff-limbed, groaning fiends who stalk the earth in search of living bodies to devour are constantly captivating viewing audiences, and haunting the dreams of the more impressionable. Zombie films range from the deadly serious and scary, such as Dawn of the Dead, to classics such as Night of the Living Dead, to series films like Zombie 1, 2, 3, and 4. Some series regarding the walking dead begin seriously, but quickly degenerate into ridiculous parody. Such was the case with the Evil Dead trilogy, a cult classic loved for its outlandish last installation. These parodies are the inspiration for other parodies, the latest of these hailing from the UK. Shaun of the Dead, directed by Edgar Wright, and obviously playing off the similarly-titled Dawn of the Dead, is a completely hilarious zombie parody, replete with dry British humor and flesh-eating fests.",0.0

The story jumps around in both time and place, switching between a large set of seemingly independent characters and stories which all intersect to make a whole far greater than the sum of its parts.  And the juxtaposition of images is amazing: the rich drug kingpin's wife overdosing on the floor of a low-level drug dealers home; the mob enforcers covered in blood in a suburban, middle class house; Bruce Willis walking down some stairs, carrying a sword, wearing a white t-shirt splattered red with blood standing in front of a blue background and proving that there can be honour among thieves.

There are dozens of ideas youÂ´ve seen in other film before, the dialogues are trivial (about junk food, foot massages, serials on television...) and the plot is very confusing when you see this movie for the first time. The solution: ""Pulp Fiction"" is a penny dreadful on celluloid. Same as other cult movies like ""A clockwork orange"" or ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" you will get something, youÂ´ve never seen before: a complete new style of film making! TarantinoÂ´s masterpiece is full of strange types, striking conversations and scenes (especially MiaÂ´s and VincentÂ´s dance, when Uma Thurman gets resuscitated...), a brilliant cast (John Travolta in the best role he ever played!), which would have been enough for five other films and a great soundtrack! At last it is also an homage about L.A., the city the director is living in. The whole story gets its thrill from the fact that the watcher has to combine all the different periods and places like a puzzle. A shame that ""Pulp Fiction"" only got two academy awards, because it has all ingredients a real cult movie has got to have: the film was copied for a hundred times, especially in the 90s, big guns became a status symbol of the modern cinema. Watch it 9 or 10 times and you will always find something new! Cult as cult can!!! My IMDb rating: a perfect 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0.0
48385,"Not for the easily offended but still pretty hilarious; Borat sees Sacha Baron Cohen pretend to be a journalist from Kazakhstan and travel around the USA with a camera crew in tow. Since he is interacting with people who don't know he's just an actor, this makes for a very interesting movie. Sacha Baron Cohen gives a terrific performance as Borat and creates one of the most memorable movie characters of the 2000s. Be warned: Borat is unbelievably offensive. While it is a funny movie and while it does have some interesting social commentary, unfortunately Borat seems more focused on offending everyone than either of those things. Also, the film should be longer than just 80 minutes since some of the time it feels rushed and potentially great scenes end too quickly. Nevertheless, Borat provides some big laughs and I admire its showcase of a comedian doing such a brave and impressive feat as going through America dressed up as a character that's being appallingly offensive and humiliating himself repeatedly. If you know what you're getting into with Borat and understand that it's a certain type of humour, you're in for a funny comedy movie, albeit one that's more notable for its technique than for huge laughs. Perhaps its best element is its thought-provoking social commentary, so Borat is definitely one of the most interesting comedies of recent times. 8/10",0.0

5816,"Corny! I love the book, but this is a pile of rubbish.; In my review of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I told why Chris Columbus was a terrible choice for the Harry Potter films. Now I will briefly say it again. CHRIS COLUMBUS WAS A TERRIBLE CHOICE FOR THE HARRY POTTER FILMS. There. Now I am going to focus in on corny parts. 1. Daniel Radcliffe's acting in Dobby-in-Harry's-bedroom scene. It was just... not good. I only 5% blame this on Daniel Radcliffe, though. He was only 12 at the time, and also, I've noticed that Dan's acting improved when he was working with Alfonso Cuaron, and improved even more when working with Mike Newell. So I blame 95% on Chris Columbus' bad direction. 2. The pudding falling on Mrs. Mason's head. This gag has been used so many times that it just makes me sick. 3. Harry's reaction to the Floo Powder. Is this all Dan is good for, Chris? Wide eyes and shock? 4. Harry's reaction to Hermione's Oculus Reparo. Harry has seen so much magic that that should barely make him blink at it. 5. Draco... he's just too much of a typical bully. 6. ""Scared, Potter?"" ""You wish."" I know it was in the book, but in that context, it was just Malfoy just being a git and Harry being annoyed. However, in the film, it is like some huge confrontation like Harry and Draco are about to fight to the death! 7. Ron in the spider scene. So this is all the character of Ron is good for, Chris? Being Harry's stupid, wimpy sidekick? 8. ""Well let's just hope that Mr. Potter will always be here to save the day."" ""Don't worry. I will be."" I read that this was in fact improvised, but it is soo corny! You can't deny that it is corny! Harry is not a little hero, he is a pre-teen who has other things to do besides having ""magical little adventures with his sidekick-like friends!"" as so many anti-Potters say. 9. Why the hell was everybody clapping for Hagrid like that?!?!?? Most people think he's stupid and he wasn't even missed by most students. It's not in the books like ""Hagrid is everybody's friend!

2571,"The movie totally ROCKS!; I admit initially being drawn to see The Matrix primarily to see the doe-eyed Keanu Reeves make his Hollywood comeback, as well as take in Laurence Fishburne's latest fine performance.  I expected to see an entertaining movie, high on special effects and low on plot (a la Godzilla, but not as pathetic).  But I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie, not only on the eye-candy level, but more importantly because the directors actually assumed that the majority of the movie-going public has some brains and likes to be intellectually stimulated.  What is really surprising is that the Wachowski brothers managed to do this using an action picture as the backdrop.  I was totally blown away during and after the film (a very rare occurrence), and I can't wait to see it again.  With only a couple of exceptions, I have never before wanted to see any movie more than once.  The Matrix is an exception. Beautiful to watch as he is, Keanu Reeves was totally believable as Neo. Naysayers claim that he can't act and that he wasn't the best person for the role, but I beg to differ.  Reeves was able to pull the leading role off, not only because of his acting ability, but also because of the fact that he's been out of the public eye for awhile.  His long absence makes the viewer want/have to reacquaint themselves with Reeves as they simultaneously get acquainted with Neo, which helps to make the storyline more buyable and digestible.  Can you imagine, say, the over-exposed Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt or Will Smith in the part of Neo? I can't, even though each was supposedly an early contender for the Neo role. In the cases of Leo, Brad and Will, their big Hollywood personas would have only distracted the audience from a rather inventive plot and story arc.  Reeves' participation allowed the audience to absorb the more complicated aspects of the story line and to pick up on the ""oh, so that's what that means"" nuances discovered in the second half of the movie.  Carrie-Anne Moss holds her own as Trinity's I'm-a-woman-but-if-you-mess-with-me-I'll-kick-your-butt persona. Secondly, it was very refreshing to see at least four ethnic actors take on important (starring and co-starring) roles in a film that tried to take a peek into the future, particularly for a science fiction film where viewers are typically hard pressed to find anyone who doesn't look like Leonardo (a la Starship Troopers, and for the most part Star Wars, Billy Dee Williams and Samuel L. Jackson not withstanding).  It was also impressive to know that the directors/producers decided to cast Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, the pivotal, totally authoritative, new millennium prophet who really drives the story.  Marcus Chong (Tank) and Julian Arahanga? (Apoc), put in rare, non-stereotypical performances as tech-savvy, anti-Matrix rebels, while the influential part of the Oracle is played by veteran actress Gloria Foster. Finally, a Hollywood film that doesn't resort to the usual ethnic drug dealer-criminal stereotypes, and finally a sci-fi film that actively promotes the idea that people of color will actually have a presence in the future. Lastly, the special effects were just mind-blowing.  I was totally freaked- out (in a good way) by Trinity's mid-air preying mantis kick, Neo's back- bending bullet-time sequence and Neo and Morpheus's balletic judo match.  Other people in the theater actually ""oohhed,"" and ""aahhed"" along with me during these breath-taking visuals.  Sure The Matrix has flaws, but what movie doesn't?  I can't wait to see this again. And there's definitely room for at least one sequel. Rating: 10 out of 10. ",0.0

But on subsequent viewings, not only has it amazed me with the implicit richness, it is now my favourite Hitchcock film, which is saying a lot as I adore films like 'Rear Window', 'Psycho', 'The Birds',etc. The screenplay written by Samuel A. Taylor, Alec Coppel and Maxwell Anderson in close collaboration with Hitchcock is based on the French crime novel 'The Living and the Dead' is brilliant and takes the film to the brink of greatness, but what pushes it over the edge and takes it into the masterpiece territory is Hitchcock's direction. Hitchcock's approach to filmmaking had a lot to do with what he called 'Pure Cinema' which involved using masterful technique and direction to put the viewer in the shoes of the protagonist and put them in the moment and make them feel the tension and the suspense. The explicit generally was more prominent than the implicit themes and subtexts. But Vertigo is different because there are endless things happening underneath and it is unbelievably layered and nuanced and deep because of Hitchcock's direction if the viewer is looking for the themes and from experience I think multiple viewings is required for that. A connection between 'Vertigo' and 'Rear Window' can be based in Hitchcock's fascination with the human tendency of voyeurism. The first part of the film involves Scottie following Madeleine obsessively which is very similar to Jeff's obsession with the goings-on in the apartment in front of his window in 'Rear Window'. A connection between 'Vertigo' and 'Psycho' can be drawn but it's far more tangential and less direct. The second half of 'Vertigo' becomes a full blown character study which has extremely disturbing subtexts which is also the case in 'Psycho' as it also has very disturbing subtexts, however 'Vertigo' in my eyes has more depth and layers. Possible interpretations of the film: Firstly it can be seen as a damning indictment of some men's obsession with their idea of female beauty and fantasies and their tendency to force their fantasies on their partners. Secondly it can be seen as an indirect indictment of the obsession of Hollywood studios with casting beautiful women. In a snide way Hitchcock might be taking the mickey out of his own self as he himself was well known for casting a lot of attractive blonde women in the majority of his films. Thirdly this can be seen as a film which makes references to the Greek myth of 'Orpheus and Eurydice'. Scottie clearly falls madly in love with Madeleine which gradually becomes an obsession. This obsession gets the better of him. When he meets Judy, his obsession with Madeleine overwhelms his thoughts and his unending attempts to relive the sensation of being with Madeleine through Julie ultimately makes him lose 'Madeleine' again which is very similar to the story of Orpheus. Hitchcock himself has talked about the disturbing elements of necrophilia that 'Vertigo' contains. This film also is a statement on the power of fiction be it in any form like books, cinema, etc. There is a particular scene towards the beginning of the film where Gavin Elster has the conversation with Scottie which makes Scottie interested in pursuing the case. The blocking in the scene is interesting. There is a particular moment where Elster is standing on what looks like an elevated stage while clearly lying and Scottie is watching him while sitting on a chair just like an audience member. 'Vertigo' can also be seen as a work on masculinity and male insecurity. I have heard reviews where the bell tower has been described as a phallic symbol. When Scottie fails to 'save' Madeleine due to his vertigo, he succumbs to feelings of despair and uselessness. He views his inability to save her due to his vertigo as a blot on his manhood. But when he figures out that he has been tricked, his rage come to the surface. He forcibly takes Judy back to the bell tower in an attempt to overcome his fear of heights and in a thematic sense 'regain' his manhood. All the themes of the script work because Hitchcock through his masterful direction allows them to work. The way Hitchcock uses colour motifs in the film is breathtaking. He uses the colour red to signify Scottie's obsession. He uses green to signify something ghostly or ethereal which is why Madeleine/Judy is seen wearing green dresses. There are two beautiful profile shots of Kim Novak once as Madeleine and the other as Judy. They beautifully juxtapose each other. The first one shows Madeleine's profile shot with the blazing red colour all around it to signify the arousal of Scottie's obsession. The second one is in Judy's apartment where we see Judy's side face which is engulfed in darkness with the neon green light all around her face showing how Judy is invisible to Scottie. All he sees is the green light which reminds him of the ghostly Madeleine. The uninterrupted 360 degree kissing shot where Scottie in his mind actually recreates the past climaxing in the still of Scottie and Judy kissing in front of the green light resulting in a rebirth of the spirit of Madeleine in Scottie's head is one of the greatest shots in film history and an example of Hitchcock's masterful vision. James Stewart plays an uncharacteristic role as Scottie. Scottie is nowhere near the lovable and kind character that he was generally known for playing. Kim Novak is absolutely brilliant playing the two roles of Madeleine and Judy. She brings in subtlety and perfectly manages to make both the characters distinct. 'Vertigo's thematic depth, rich use of colour and Hitchcock's masterful storytelling make it a masterpiece.",0.0

When the movie first started we were looking at each other like what the hell is he (borat) talking about? :-) but then as the movie played on, we were almost on the floor laughing. There were huge, loud bursts of laughs through out the theater. I was not offended at all and I am African American. I didn't find the comments offensive because after all-this movie is a comedy! Borat definitely showed true American people!! He said some silly, racist things but he basically let the people he was fooling with do the talking! See this movie if you want a good laugh at reality. ~Myras-Mommy~",0.0
48385,"Nasty, brutish and unfortunately not short; Sacha Baron Cohen is a highly educated English Jew: the total opposite of the characters he plays. The film begins extremely well, with parodies of old Russian-style propaganda films and wildly absurd characters but quickly degenerates into a series of TV sketches, some of which are pointless, some insulting to the participants, and some just clumsy and amateurish. Those which do not fall into these categories are mostly unpleasant. There are moments of would-be pathos in order to soften us up. Even when very funny (and sometimes it is) it leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. I suspect it is actually A FILM WITH A MESSAGE.",0.0
6537,"With the creator of the series gone, what is left of an epic story; Many people, including I were very doubtful Terminator 3 would amount to anything, after the departure of James Cameron from the project. Other blows for fans of the series were that neither Edward Furlong nor Linda Hamilton would show up for the sequel and that not even William Wisher (who co-wrote both of the previous films wrote anything for this one). Instead the writers were people of little fame and the  director was not too famous as well, only having had a small Â‘hit' called U-571 in the year 2000 (grossing over 100 Million Dollars world-wide). The only comfort for the doubtful (such as I), was that Mario Kassar (producer of T2) and Gale Anne Hurd (producer and co-creator of The Terminator and producer of T2) were attached to the project as producers. It took a quite a time to cast T3 and it left me with mixed feelings. First it was said that Famke Janssen (the best Bond-girl ever) was to play the TerminatriX, but she turned it down. Then Edward Furlong was not going to be present as John Connor. By then I'd given up hope, that this could ever work. Then they cast Nick Stahl, who I extremely liked in Bully, as the Â‘new' John Connor and Claire Danes (of Romeo + Juliet fame) was cast as well. This looked more promising, but sold I wasn't. The trailer came along and I liked it pretty much, but still I stayed away from the big cinema and awaited the Terminators arrival at our local cinema. When he came I went, and when I left, I left satisfied. Terminator 3 starts out with a great spoken intro by John Connor and then delves deeply into matter with which all Terminator fans are well accustomed too: Terminators arriving on earth after being sent back in time, desperately in the need of clothes. This is what all Terminator films start with and this though this one does so with a different type of approach. In the first part of the film, Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a good one-liner after another and the action scenes are predominant (as they remain for the bigger part of the film). The one-liners are not always funny because of what is said, but because of the way it is said in and the facial expression Arnold makes when he utters the remarks. The action scenes are enormous and nothing short of spectacular (which is something I do not say easily, since I've seen a lot of action on film). This, along with some surprises in the story, are what keeps you on the edge of you seat for the ride and the only thing that could be considered drawback in this film, is the fact that the action sequences are too dominant at times. But what about the times, when there are no action scenes? What about the acting? Well, Arnie was as good as ever in his role as the almost indestructible Terminator (although his last few lines were corny and almost overshadowed his entire performance). Claire Danes did an ok job and Nick Stahl was adequate as the new John Connor. Kristina Loken was ok as the T-X, but at times I felt that more could have done with her. Maybe they could have made more use of her looks and maybe they could have made her act a little less than the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) in T2. But hey, if everything was good, that would be the perfect scenario and hence, the perfect film! Whenever did you see that one? Another drawback of the film manifests itself toward the end. There seems to be a desperate attempt by the makers of the film, to make Arnold say some memorable lines as he did in The Terminator and T2. I hate to say it, but they fall flat and almost ruin the ending. I said almost! Because when you think almost everything is done and the rest of the story is obvious, there is one surprise left for John and Kate (Claire Danes) and this is, what makes the film really worth while. Those last seven minutes or so, when John and Kate are on their own and when once again, there is a spoken part. That part only (together with the spoken intro) is worth the price admission. Really well done! The finishing touch comes with Brad Fiedel's theme, which I so dearly missed in the beginning of the film. Why oh why did they not play it at the beginning as well??? All in all this is good effort and the slightly Â‘worse' rating in comparison to The Terminator and T2 only stems from Arnold's last one-liners and the fact that this was more of a summer popcorn flick than were the other two. 7,75 out of 10 post scriptum: expect a fourth installment!",0.0
4388,"Only a few funny bits in a mostly unfunny film.; The first Scary Movie was OK, it was gross but worth a watch. This one is covered in toilet humour and half baked sex jokes. But there was indeed some really funny bits if you look hard enough, like the keep away with the skeleton (Overlong though and they ruined it with swearing), the ""Look in the music room"" (Ruined again by swearing) and the bit with the statue that says ""When you go black, you never go back"" were 3 funny parts in a mostly bad movie. In this movie, we see Cindy and her friends from the first movie (With Christopher Masterson as an added bonus) who are offered to go to a scary house with a immediate A with completion. From there ""funny"" hyjinks ensure. The film is worth a watch for people who have absolutely nothing else to watch or just want to see an OK scary movie spoof. Overall, the film is bad but with a few exceptions which at times is quite clever (Many jokes were ruined by swearing though). I rate this film 49%.",0.0
5816,"A Great Sequel, but Not as Good as the First Film; After the success of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, it was a very hard film to beat. I was worried Chamber of Secrets wouldn't live up to my expectations. It seems I was right. Don't get me wrong here. This film matches the standard of magic, sets, action and acting. It is simply amazing, no doubt about it. I wanted something more, however, something mind-blowing. That spark just wasn't there. On the other hand, the addition of other stars made this film more sinister and, in some cases, funny. Jason Isaacs as Draco Malfoy (the awesome Tom Felton)'s Father was ideally cast. He had the image and the villainous voice that just made me want to punch him. Kenneth Branagh very nearly steals the film as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, a cocky teacher who is revealed to be a fraud and a faker. Once again, Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter played his part very well, better than he did in Philosopher's Stone. Rupert Grint again plays his comedy role of Ron Weasley brilliantly. Emma Watson reprises her role as smart Hermione Granger, clearly enjoying herself. Bonnie Wright as Ron's younger sister Ginny Weasley deserves a mention, too, even though she had so little screen time, she still played an important role in the film, which saw her being revealed as the person who opened the Chamber of Secrets. At the start of the film, everything is all bright and chirpy, but towards the end it gets darker. The showdown between Harry and a big Basilisk snake will leave you on the edge of your seat. Overall, this film is brilliant, but just didn't top the first Harry Potter film.",0.0
2571,"Interesting and Thought Provoking; The Matrix is a movie that has done its ""historic homework"" (so to speak) and has given us a frightening view of the future if we continue to depend so much on computers. The special effects are top notch, especially during the fight scenes and so is the acting.  Newcomer Carrie-Anne Moss delivers the role of Trinity with enough attitude and sympathy to fit the part perfectly.  Keanu Reeves improves his somewhat hit-and-miss resumÃ© with another gem and excellent role (as Neo) that will open more doors for him and perhaps give him more respect as an actor.  Finally, Laurence Fishburne gives his role as Morpheus enough seriousness and intellect to once again display his broad range of acting ability.  Overall, The Matrix is a sci-fi romp ""think"" flick that deserves not to be missed.",0.0
296,"A Cinematic Wonder; Quentin Tarantino is a modern cinematic master, but he isn't a Hitchcock, a Spielberg, or a Nolan. Those directors, wonderful as they are, took the normalcies left behind by their filmmaking ancestors and spiced them up, making the familiar suddenly indelible. Tarantino, on the other hand, has never made something familiar to the viewer. His films, though often paying homage to the greatest of the grind house and the sturdiest of the studio system, twist anything even resembling an expectation Â— maybe the plots of Tarantino's films have been portrayed in some way or another before, but don't bet that the dialogue, the actors, the dynamics that fill each scene will match anything you've come to know. ""Pulp Fiction"" is his most widely adored film, the one where his notable violent tendencies are kept to a comic minimum, the one where his dialogue never rings offensive and his exchanges glow with the smooth wittiness of yesterday's fools. Situations don't play out with the professional easiness of a square that went to film school: everything feels as though it were washed and dried by a cinematic nut more fond of staying home Friday nights watching Pam Grier kick ass than going out on the town with slightly drunken friends. Even watching a bad movie was better than experiencing the mundanities of life, because bad movies, bad as they were, took them away from the troublesome thing called reality. And so ""Pulp Fiction"" is a stew of cinematic wonders, some sexy, some funny, some tragic, some bloody Â— like the sordid comic books of the same name, there's unrelenting sleazy appeal to be found among the campy ruins. But the film is more than camp: it's radical noir, thunderously romanticized, delirious in its aesthetical violence. Tarantino doesn't just film his actors, his scenes: he falls in love with them, clinging on to their every move, making even the smallest of a detail, of a character, seem enormous in their connection to the overall buoyant picture. Tiny intricacies, such as the way John Travolta casually corrects Uma Thurman when she refers to all the waitresses at Jack Rabbit Slim's as Marilyn (one is Monroe, yes, but the others are actually schlockily dressed like Mamie Van Doren and Jayne Mansfield), says much about Tarantino's filmmaking personality. As much as he loves the icons and movies the general public refers to as masterpieces, he can't help himself from putting the underdogs on a pedestal and letting them shine, even if it's for a blink Â— because ""Pulp Fiction"" is directed by a cinephile who appreciates everything about cinema, not just the conventional Oscar nymphos. There's something about the film that still seems as dangerous as it did in 1994 Â— there has always been daring auteurs in the slippery slopes of Hollywood, but exciting is the way that Tarantino pushed, and continues to push, boundaries, making madness seem mainstream, luminous. Stories intertwine in a fashion reminiscent of 1956's ""The Killing"", time hopping yet staggering in its ability to complete each other's sentences. ""Pulp Fiction"" follows an assortment of characters, all connected: assassins Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson), powerful gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), his wife, the chic, cocaine addicted Mia (Uma Thurman), washed up boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), and bank robbers Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth). How they are associated I cannot say (it would ruin the genius of Tarantino's screenplay). But each character, so well drawn and so flawlessly portrayed (the actors are excellent, their characterizations already iconic in some shape or form), is unforgettable. Look at the way Vincent covers up his lack of smarts with his ability to go from agreeable to brutal in a matter of seconds; how Jules can enjoy the taste of a hamburger while ready to commit a hit because he's too damn used to killing; how Mia can make the mere smoking of a cigarette bolster the same sexy power of Ava Gardner or Louise Brooks; how Butch is willing to risk he and his girlfriend's (Maria de Medeiros) life for a watch passed (with disturbing fervor, I might add) on through generations; how Honey Bunny and Pumpkin don't think about the risks of robbing a restaurant because life is short and sin is fun. Even the most despicable of characters participate in conversation so complex and blackly hilarious we can hardly help but side with them. Tarantino doesn't just write characters; he lives vicariously through them, as if he kept them locked inside his mind until it became time to write the screenplay. Among the finest scripts ever written, startling is how confident every line is, how well the performers deliver each sentence. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a near perfect film, and though I prefer ""Kill Bill"", one can hardly deny the genius of Tarantino. How many directors create worlds as simultaneously grimy, cool, dangerous, humorous, appealing, as he does? If you can name five others, I'll have to take your word for it and revoke mine.",0.0
2571,"Good Special Effects and Lots of Action; ""Neo"" (Keanu Reeves) is a computer programmer who is attempting to discover a hidden truth on his own which others want to remain hidden.

Anyway, rather than reveal any more of the plot and risk spoiling the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a pretty good science-fiction movie that incorporates good special effects and lots of action. Or perhaps its more accurate to say that this is a good action film that relies upon science-fiction and special effects. Either way it's a pretty good film and the only reason I didn't rate it higher was that I thought some of the dialogue was a bit weak and the action went a bit overboard. All things considered then I rate this movie as above average and I recommend it to those who enjoy science-fiction and action movies all rolled into one.",0.0

6493,"Completely uninspired; ""Alex and Emma"" has nifty opening credits, done in a kind of 1920's art-deco style that mirrored the 1920's story within a story.  Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there.  This isn't a bad or reprehensible movie, just a dull, uninspired one. What went wrong? That's what I kept asking myself all the time I was watching it.  Rob Reiner is (or was) a fine director; after all, he made ""When Harry Met Sally,"" the gold standard for romantic comedies.  The idea had some promise: a writer's work reflects and is reflected by his real life and love. Usually I really love this type of literary stuff.  So why??? Partly the fault lies with the script.  Reiner seems to have literally thrown Jeremy Leven's first rough draft up on the screen.  The script is so poorly thought out even in its basics that you can't believe any thought was devoted to it. For instance, if you were a Cuban thug and your only way of getting the money a guy owes your Mafia boss is to make sure your victim gets an advan ce for his book, would the first thing you do really be to destroy the computer he's writing it on?  Evidently Cuban thugs aren't very bright (at least not in this movie).  Alex's need for a stenographer is unbelievable too.  He couldn't ask his editor for the loan of just a few dollars to rent a laptop or at least a typewriter?  (Maybe they should have had the thugs break his arm, so he would have to hire a stenographer).  And why lie to her right off the bat for no reason -- no reason, that is, except that in a romantic comedy, the guy always lies to the girl?  Again, Adam, the lead in the novel that Alex is writing is supposed to be going on vacation to write the great American novel, but we never hear of him writing a word once he gets there. The general lack of imagination extends to the supposed comic bits, such as Emma being the au pairs of different nationalities, but almost nothing was done with the idea except to have her speak in funny accents for a few seconds for each one. The flat, uninteresting characterizations are another problem. The ones in the 1920's story are, like the art deco credits, quite literally cartoons. The story within the story, as well as the writer-falls-in-love-with-stenographer idea, was taken from Dostoevsky's ""The Gambler,"" but something sure as heck got lost in translation. Sophie Marceau is wasted in her role. Alex and Emma themselves are no better. They are tenth-generation copies of the most stereotypical romantic comedy hero and heroine. Alex is your average nice guy, clueless in the generic way about women; Emma is the combination of anal-retentive annoyance and adorable ditz patented by Meg Ryan in ""When Harry met Sally."" (Her character is also astonishingly uninformed about the purpose and nature of literature, probably so Alex can explain it to the audience; this doesn't help). I guess Reiner knows that this has worked before.  Maybe that's the problem. Couldn't Alex, as a modern writer, have more edge? A little beard stubble is not enough.  And a woman who wants to criticize a man's approach to romance, writing a sex scene, etc., could do much better than Emma does (though Adam's idea of a sex scene for his novel is one of the only vaguely witty bits in the film). No matter how good the performances were, they couldn't save this movie. Luke Wilson is one of the most uncharismatic actors I know, and he seems barely able to move his body (though he at times has a nice energy with the lines and good comic timing).  Kate Hudson at times is radiant, and is perhaps the thing most worth watching in this mess.  She tosses off her accents with aplomb too. But why can't there be a little re-thinking of the romantic comedy? It's getting a real black eye and a bad name it doesn't really deserve, as so many snide comments by guys on this site prove. And for you guys on imdb who snicker at the very idea of ""chick flicks"" -- just go watch another movie based on a COMIC BOOK, OK? ",0.0
527,"Shocking, to say the least; In 1993 I saw this movie in the theater the day it opened here in Holland, and it made such an impact on me that I was afraid to watch it ever since. Now, seven years later, I watched it again, alone, on a saturday night, and again it was one of the most harrowing movie experiences of my life, even on the small screen. This one is up there among other movies about the Holocaust, such as Night and Fog (Resnais, 1956) and Shoah (1985). I think that when you watch these three movies you can catch a glimpse of what these have gone through during WW2, although this of course can never be established through film, this horror. All during this movie you are bombarded in a Spielberg-fashion speed with images that are so gruesome that they bring you on the verge of tears. It was only till the last scene of the real Schindler Jews and the actors laying stones on Schindler's grave that I broke. The music, the imagery, the sensitivity with which Spielberg handled this subject was so convincing and staggering that it truly made me cry. I don't think Spielberg will ever make a more personal movie than this. During the screening I attended seven years ago some people found the imagery too much to handle, and walked out of the theater. It was just too much. I think 1,000 words are not nearly enough to express what I felt and still feel about this movie, so I will just say: If you haven't seen this movie yet, see it.

The wonderful icing on the proverbial cake is, of course, the beautiful, touching, and haunting music by Bernard Herrmann. This melancholy soundtrack brings my favorite movie to completion. I only have two small wishes about this film to make it better in my eyes, that the shot which pans up to show the outside of the court room hearing was better done and that the shot of the pillow hitting the ground when Scottie asks Madeleine to sit by the fire was repeated when Scottie does the same thing with Judy.

For example, it is even impossible not to be in love with Mia Wallace because Uma Thurman rescued her so successful that she gives the impression to you. Likewise Bruce Willis, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson made a very good job. This movie shows the distinctions between choosing the bad and the good one.

If I wanted to delve into the flaws of the film I could argue that Arnie's constant insistance that he's a machine with no emotion is undermined near the end by his apparent fight with conscience as he trys to overcome his ""evil"" programming at the hands of the TX. All in all though as an addition to the series it's pure fun with all the dark forboding that earlier installments indicated e.g. the end of the world as we know it !! ENJOY.",0.0

Many, many people have a huge problem with this film, but they are just not getting into it. You must see this film. I have heard it said that it will change your life.

Here's a movie that offer bad acting, a incomplete and incoherent plot and finally a lot of Â«deja vuÂ» action sequence. We can only ask ourselves if this movie is not in fact a big budget pilot for a TV serie ? There's only one great thing in this movie: the ending. So,if you want to see a very good Terminator story here some suggestion: - Rent (again) Terminator and Terminator 2 - Read the great comics books published by Dark Horse Comics ",0.0
6537,"How T3 continues the trilogy; As a big fan of Terminator movies I went to see this movie in the first day is was released. I was really interested to see how such a difficult assignment as creating a new episode of legendary Terminator movies could be done. I remember that I was 14 when I saw the first Terminator movie. For me at that time it was one of the worst scary movies I had ever seen. The last scene when the terminator had only a metal skeleton remaining and it was chasing Sarah Connor in a factory was unforgettable. I don't remember ever being as horrified in a movie. Then at the age of 21 I saw the Terminator 2. That was another ultimate experience in a different way. It followed the dark atmosphere of the 1st Terminator but also showed an incredible action power in a movie that was never seen before. It was similar enough to the first Terminator but at the same time shocking in its own way. The ""Arnold's jokes"" in the movie became legendary. So, when I went to see this 3rd episode at the age of 32 I was really curious to see how filmmakers would be able to create another part of the very unique Terminators movies. Well, I try not not repeat all the comments that other people have already said here. It wasn't definitely a bad movie but the feeling I got was that it was too much just copying the nice characters and jokes from T2 and didn't have enough fresh ideas. Maybe only James Cameron would have had enough courage to make a completely new kind of film, copying enough from the previous parts but still creating something new. Now as it is, it left a slight feeling that producers just wanted to get profits with the old bullet proof movie format. If I say something concrete on the movie, I certainly liked the new sexy TX character and I have to say that she was so good that even that alone would be a good enough reason to watch this movie.  I also liked the Skynet robots that started to rise in the end of the movie. That was slightly touching the atmosphere of the original movies. It was great to see how the judgment day really happened. I also liked Arnold still showing his best action in his 50's. John Connor's character was OK although too far away from the character in T2 to be reliable. The worst thing in the movie was the direction compared to other Terminator movies. Maybe it is just James Cameron's extraordinary skills that made a story flow in the previous episodes but this film seemed more like a row of separate sequences. It was too much repeating the same jokes as seen in T2 and in some sequences this movie was even trying to get cheap credits by making fun of T2 (which I hated). Well, compared to other movies I've seen recently this is certainly worth to watch. It partly feels like a cheap copy of the previous Terminators but at the same time it gives some enjoyable moments for all the true Terminator fans in a new decade.",0.0
6537,"Rise of the Machines , Fall of Man; Let's make one thing clear ; I don't think anyone is gonna ( or not )  see this movie because of a favorable/unfavorable  review. This IS Terminator 3. You know what the story's about. You've seen the prequels . You were not born yesterday. Hence this review will mention some specifics of the movie and if you haven't seen it yet , be warned . I went to the theatre with some very simple expectations. I wanted to see Arnie be THE Terminator once again. I figured I was in for some death , chaos and mayhem. You know what? It's OK by me to want some of that every once and awhile. I've enjoyed some very thoughtful, emotional and purposeful films. But now I was in it for all the ' wrong ' reasons. Strangely enough I was rather let down by this sequel . It wasn't just the holes in the script , some of them gaping. Didn't bother me. Way I see it there  really shouldn't be a sequel to Part II ; it was too perfect for that. So the only way to link it with this sequel was to blow the script wide open. It wasn't the horrendous error in the casting of Nick Stahl in the role of John Connor either. This young man is simply in the wrong business ; he lacks any trace of personal charisma and charm a Hollywood actor should have. His casting in what is essentially the lead role in a multi-million dollar production is bizarre to say the least. The only time I was satisfied with him being in the frame was when Arnie got his hands around his throat and lifted him clear off the floor. Right there and then, if he would have wasted him the movie would have taken a twist in the right direction and broken through all that was expected from the script. But he didn't :-( Neither was the incredible naivity of the dialogs nor screenplay what blew it for me . You kinda shake the bad impression off when a frightened young woman downs what looks like a menacing small jet with an AK-47; OK so the Russians paid for some commercial exposure too. Why should only the Fins from Nokia be the smart ones and benefit from some ' gray ' advertising? The main sticking points for me ( and boy was I surprised from that ) were actually the only signs of intelligence this movie tried to show. The most obvious was of course the ending. Just as we are ready for the final showdown  ,the mother of all battles , a glimpse of the monster itself ,  there's a tremendous let down with everything ending in a dusted place which looks forgotten from history with some AM radio broadcasts announcing the end of the world. I suppose with this the writers tried to show some originality. Originality is good. I've loved originality in all the mini sci-fi and horror series. But you know what? This is not a one-hour special episode of some TV series. This is a major blockbuster movie with fans of the original storyline and heroes who came to see the End coming as the proverbial Mack truck running clear through the screens. But this film doesn't End. It just fades away like a wounded animal that no one would put out of it's misery. That was the first thought after the film. But something deeper bothered me as well. The sour taste in my mouth somehow expanded in my mind as well. There was a message somewhere in there as well , hidden , lurking. Then it dawned on me ; what's the real difference between the second and the third Terminator ? It's the outlook of the Future. In Terminator II Linda Hamilton conveys a positive message ; Future is what we make of it. But here in the third part there's a much darker message: Future is inevitable. And the Future is the clash with the Machine . The Machine is our enemy and no matter what, it shall one day turn on us. So be afraid. Be very afraid. Dig some holes in your back yard. Stock up on supplies. Get some guns. Cause the reckoning is coming. And it doesn't matter that there are no enemies are left. It doesn't matter that the threat is not there any more ( parallel with the empty, dusted , obsolete nuke shelter ) There's a reason always for keeping a stockpile ready to blow the world up: It's there to be used and we'll use it on ourselves. And if you aren't afraid of the Russians anymore , if the aliens are nowhere to be found then don't worry. Look into your study , into your children's rooms, into your workspace. The Enemy is there , disguised , dormant , posing as a friend. Till it's time for Him to rise and destroy us all. But the Leader will emerge from the rubble with his few chosen saved by the rat holes they have dug for themselves. And he'll gather his few chosen ones and fly the American flag again ( as the tell-tale scene of the future in the beginning goes ) Well guess again Mr Director ,Producer and Writer. Cause the flag you have waving there shouldn't stand for fear and an Army of One. Although there's plenty of folk out there who'd like that... ",0.0

Quentin Terentino at his finest with this script and his directing skills, John Travolta's career is reborn with this film, Samuel L. Jackson was perfect for his role, Uma Thurman great as always, Bruce Willis plays the tough all American as usual, and Ving Rahmes is as always the ruthless boss, one other great thing about this film is that is is one of the last things to come out of Hollywood that wasn't work-shopped and commercially exploited till the point that there is no personality or originality to the story this is definitely one of the best films ever, without a doubt, and my personal favorite of all time... enjoy!",0.0

48385,"If you don't like this movie, please die!; So, this movie is the best I have seen the past year, and Sasha Baron Cohen should get an academy award for this, since he apparently played his role before, during and after the camera was rolling. The humor does mock some people yes, but if you have to be so politically correct that you can't enjoy this movie, you just haven't gotten the point. This movie is made in order to reveal other peoples prejudism, rather than creating them. This prejudism is show through various characters like a conservative rodeo cowboy, the general man on the NY subway, a party of Christian over class people, a group of feminists, etc. The most funny part is watching how all these people take themselves, and their causes so seriously (espessialy those feminists. So if you can't see the humor in this you are just TOO politically correct in your mind, and a double moralist, as everyone carries these prejudice thoughts shown in the movie. Borat has only driven them to the extreme. PS. YES there is a very anti semetistic scene in this movie, but anyone who has done their background research will know that Cohen is a Jew, who holds the sabbath holy, so this ONE scene, as well as the rest are probably VEEERY ironic",0.0

2571,"Visually stunnning, initially edgy and engaging, but ultimately disappointing.; Is The Matrix worth the price of admission?  Absolutely.  With effects that are masterfully employed to slam home the horror of the main character's (Neo's) revelations at the start of the film as well as to bring the superhuman abilities of the characters to life, the door price is more than worthwhile.  It doesn't hurt that the fight scenes are beautifully choreographed, the performances by Reeves and Fishburne are at least competent (though both are certainly capable of better), and Carrie-Anne Moss turns in what is arguably the best performance of the show (plus, she's a pleasure to look at).  To top it off, the art direction and costumes were top notch, greatly enhancing the very dark ""post- apocalyptic/GenX angst meets John Woo"" feel of the movie.  BUT... Sadly the plot is uninspired, becoming a veritable blueprint of science fiction cliches and totally predictable plot twists after the film's initial and only surprising shocker (which was itself pretty easy to come by in the press prior to release).  The effects and action sequences go some distance in making up for this, but even when the Wachowski brothers go for high-adrenaline, John Woo style action sequences, my interest frequently flagged due to poor edits that concentrated more on showing actors in cool poses than on keeping my pulse rate up and showcasing some truly stellar rapid-fire choreography.  A far too liberal use of slow motion shots (Is Keanu on screen?  Slo mo!) also managed to lower my pulse rate as well as the pacing of action that was (presumably) supposed to be fast and furious. An absurdly bad ""heroic"" comeback by Neo at film's end hammered home the lack of thought and effort that went into the story. This is a good sophomore effort by the Wachowskis, but ultimately it is just a ""flavor of the month"" that will be tossed in the dustbin with Independence Day and Men in Black to be forgotten when The Next Big Thing comes along. The truly disappointing part is that if half the care had been put into the story as was lavished on effects and fight sequences, this could have been a true science fiction cinema milestone.  And that's a damn shame.",0.0
2571,"Why I liked ""The Matrix""...; First of all I liked the movie very much. Why? For several reasons. First, I generally like this kind of movies. Second, I personally enjoyed to 'catch out' subtleties and associations concerning other movies or books. Third, I liked the philosophy in the film, more even than the action scenes. And, fourth of the reasons is that I understand quite well the problems Mr. Anderson dealt with in his regular job :) The thing most amazing was that in this movie it was almost impossible to tell what is going to happen in the next minute... Some movies are perfectly predictable - this one is not. Almost. I would also make the end slightly different, but this one was also thrilling. Hugo Weaving is perfect in his role. The Wachowski team did some really good work. I feel afraid to wait for Matrix II - somehow I don't believe it is going to be as good as this one is. I hope, however, that I'm wrong.",0.0
71057,"9 (Dollars of my Money Wasted); Nine was just awful, critics thought it was OKAT, I thought it was probably one of the worst movies of all time, and it doesn't seem to catch my attention. The biggest problem is something a rookie director would make, and I don't mind the outstanding visuals. The huge problem is it is Horribly fast paced. At the beginning, you are shown a clip of 9 being created, and then it shows the creator dying. After that, he goes out in the streets and already meets a new member, and only 5 minutes in, there is an action scene when the monster comes and takes the other guy he met, and then he leaves. That's just 5 minutes, now, the movie shows a telescope of 9 walking forward and then he falls, he wakes up in a room and he is being stitched together by a new friend. (and only 10 minutes in) He meets number 8 and number 1. Also, there is poor character development, you only see that he is a total wiener. And quite old. Then you meet what I believe is 6, and he's really addicted to the source. Now what about 7? 7 was believed to be dead and they meet 7 while they looked for the guy the monster took, and 7 appears while they're being attacked, how could you meet a friend after 10,000 years after they were believed to be dead? Wow, how stupid. But, the movie is so bad, and so poorly crafted, it has that so-bad-its-good kind of feeling that makes you want to keeping on watching the awfulness. One final note: Voice acting was cancer, and so was the dialog.",0.0
4388,"Oh, come on! Let go! Trust me, it's not that bad!; OK, not Oscar material and this was pretty badly made. But again like most brainless comedies, I walked in the theater with a good mood and expecting a laugh and I got that with ""Scary Movie 2"". I mean people are being so harsh on this film, I understand, I know this isn't the greatest movie or comedy. But if you aren't expecting fun and laughter, I think normally you just feel like bashing the movie then. We have some of the old cast members from the original Scary Movie: Anna Farris, a surprising return of Regina Hall, and Marlon and Shawn Wayne. This Scary Movie took on the films like The Exorcist(hilarious scene by the way), Poltergeist, The Haunting, Mission Impossible, Charlie's Angels, and What lies beneath. With some great add ons like Tim Curry, I just had a great time. Tori Spelling, yeah, she's a bit scary, but for some reason she still gets her equal share of laughs. The Butler just killed me with the hand. Yes, it was gross, but I think you just have to let go and just go with the joke. Scary Movie 2 isn't the best comedy ever, but it's a decent one with your brain turned off. Sick jokes, yes, and very crude one's, this movie isn't for everyone. But I think if you enjoyed the first Scary Movie, you'll enjoy this one too! 7/10",0.0
903,"You can't get to the bottom of it; Jimmy Stewart transcends his form of Rear Window here, and needs to. Vertigo is an elusive love story and the character of Scotty shuttles more actively, yet more subtly between the gravitation of his desire for Kim Novak's Madeleine and the peaceful stasis of his retirement. The chief conspirator in the mystery and power of the film is the music. Bernard Hermann's score is a paradigm of the filmscore rendered in post-Tristan hoch-romanticism, rich in both power AND nuance. Where the simplest passages of expositional action would require a low profile underscore the music has an agenda already looking ahead to the power and vertiginous confusion of the film's intent. Watch the flower shop sequence again; it's got it all, visual dialogue, cunning use of foreshortened shots and mirrors and overwhelming colour both visually and sonically. And in a relatively minor sequence. So Hitchcock is employing all his favourite devices and to great effect. Symbolism is no passenger either. The symbol that is impossible to miss throughout is that of colour. A 1996 analytic essay (by Jim Emerson, available online) outlines these in great detail, from the greens of passion and reds of warning to the subsiduary colours for guilt (blue/grey) and peace or comfort (yellow/beige). I was reminded of British colourist Howard Hodgkin's canvas Lovers (1992), an Apollonian/Dionysian tsunami of red and green as iridescent as the Technicolour tints and filters used in the film. So the film is about the doppelganger tension inside a character - the wrenching of his alternates. Should Scotty abandon his rocking chair and sunset retirement in search of not only Madeleine but whatever it is that makes him pursue her (a sort of meta-lust)? When he does, which we all want him to do, will he be able to bring it back around and make sense of it all for us? Well, just when we think he has, Hitchcock blows the cosy moral cadence apart again. The film is as daring in its ending as in its conception and execution and is surely a touchstone of great cinema - great art - as a result. 9/10",0.0
2571,"Is the Reality We Accept the Real Reality or a False Reality We Can Handle?; The film The Matrix is about the journey of Neo as he travels through the mundane life as a low level hacker and software developer of a large company into the only hero that can save suppressed humans from the ""real reality."" Neo's mentor Morpheus introduces Neo into the Matrix, which is the real reality of how the robots took over mankind and use their bodies as sustenance. Morpheus and his team, including Neo's eventual love interest Trinity, guide Neo and help him develop into ""The One"" that can save all. In essence, he is mankind's savior and the only one that can defeat the army of artificial intelligence. The theme in this popular film is the struggle of human dignity and the search for one's own purpose. In the beginning of the movie, we see Neo growing incredibly unsatisfied and bored by his daily routine. For a new scene, he follows his clients (who he recently retrieved hacking information for) into a club, where Trinity begins his journey of what his purpose is and what the true reality is. By mentors Morpheus and Trinity, Neo discovers that his entire life was nothing but a front to keep the humans alive, while the cyborgs continue to feed on them while also populating them only as a food source. Throughout the film, viewers can relate to the struggle of trying to find a sense of purpose. Many struggle through hurdles and may find others' expectations quite overwhelming. The theme that one can succeed and accomplish their purpose leaves moviegoers with a positive note and a can do attitude. One of the high points of the film that is easily forgotten is the point in which Morpheus has been kidnapped by the Agents and is slowly dying as they attempt to hack his brain for codes in order to track the freed humans. Just when we think Morpheus might breathe his last breath, Neo and Trinity arrive with a helicopter facing the opening of the exposed office in the high-rise building. Soon, bullets fly from both the Agents and the team of Trinity and Neo. In this shot, time appears to slow as we see rain fall slowly towards the office floor and we can see the bullet paths as a vacuum of air is created at such a high velocity. This is what makes The Matrix great. It created action scenes and breathed new life into them by changing the way the moviegoer sees it and forces them to focus on details that would be impossible to see at a normal speed frame. It creates a high appreciation for things that we normally would not pay attention to in a typical action scene. The talent of cinematographer Bill Pope is highlighted in scenes such as these, making The Matrix one of the best action films to date. There are two techniques which highlight the theme of the film and keep the story interesting in The Matrix are freeze frame (and slow motion) as well as camera angle. For a majority of The Matrix, the movie was filmed from an objective view and often at eye level. This view helps the moviegoer see the awesome graphics that may have been missed if filmed from a subjective view. For example, when Trinity is first cornered by the local police in the abandoned building, the viewer would likely assume that action is going to take place, but they are unsure of what. Based on many action movies of the past, one can assume it will involve a lot of rapid movement and somebody being hurt and killed, which nothing too surprising, especially at the beginning of the film. On the contrary, in the midst of Trinity fighting the officers, we suddenly see her frozen in mid- air with a kick flying toward and unfortunate officer's face. The camera circles Trinity as we see cops in mid action preparing to win the fight against the lone woman. However, as time assumes to normal speed, one sees Trinity fighting and the camera rapidly moving around her and her victims. From here, the film takes off in the action-plot film. Another example of cinematic effect would be the slow motion of the last fight as Neo fights Agent Smith. As Neo discovers he truly is the one, he seems to fight Agent Smith with overwhelming calm as the we view from a spectator angle the action that keeps us held to our seats. Neo fights slowly but tactfully in slow motion and ultimately defeating Agent Smith. These techniques help us pay attention to the detail of each action-packed scene, and reminds the moviegoer of Neo's purpose, which was defeating the agents. His journey reminds us that we all are searching for our purpose in life and must overcome barriers in order to find it. In conclusion, The Matrix is a great film to watch. The theme of human struggle to find one's own purpose is obvious and can be seen highlighted in the action points. Throughout each physical conflict, time is slowed and characters are frozen to see the detail of each battle. It gives the viewer time to think instead of forcing one to follow a fast motion scene, to focus on Neo's personal struggle to find his calling. The film is a little dated, but the techniques used to enhance the plot and the action make The Matrix a legend.",0.0

It is impossible not to be deeply exhilarated with the magnificent cinematography. The colors are mind-boggling, you can almost feel the texture of the beautiful costumes, and the naked passion of the fairytale can not be resisted.

On the down side, I found the pace to be a bit too frantic, I was a little worn out by the end. Also, being a yank, the accents wore me out at times.

We learn early on in the movie that it's only delayed. The war with the machines is inevitable. The plot is complex but understandable. It's not like The Matrix Reloaded.

38038,"CHEEEEEEESE!  a very cute, rambunctious comedy; The folks at Aardman have done a cool, cute and wild adaptation of their short films of Wallace and Gromit to feature length, as the man and his dog, inventors who seem to have more of the intelligence (or practicality) for the latter. In this case they've invented a machine that can capture all of the bunnies that are eating up the crops all over a quiet English village. In particular for Mrs. Tottington (or 'Totty' for those who are 'intimate'), much to the chagrin of Victor Quartermaine, who just wants to kill all the rabbits with his trust rifle. Wallace and Gromit seem to have success with their machine, but Wallace has a mix-up: a machine he's made to make more food suddenly criss-crosses himself with a rabbit - the curse is on! A lot of this is about as much light-hearted fun that a kid's movie could ask for, but it also tips its hat to the oldest tradition in classic cartoon slapstick: Looney Tunes, which in turn is indebted to much silent comedy and vaudeville. Granted, the Aardman guys (Nick Park and Steve Box) have a bunch more gimmicks and tricks and ingenuity with their material. It's never less than amazing to see how they put the stop motion to use, even when a joke or a gag might be a little on the funny ""ho-ho"" not funny ""ha-ha"" side (a tired criticism but I'll say it). Curse of the Were-Rabbit works so well on all fronts for the audience, in its warped story and sudden dips into exposition (the Golden Bullet story is a doozy), Park and Box and company never lose sight of glee in the material. It's fuzzy and warm-hearted and completely off-the-wall for the kids (even the very youngest will love the adventures and strange gadgets, such as the truck Wallace and Gromit drive around in), and for adults there's little barbs of funky, absurdist tones in the midst of a classic English farce. Only (and I'm probably a minority opinion here) when compared to Chicken Run it's almost a little slight a work- there's less any plot than there is a series of running gags, and of course lots of puns involving bunnies and monsters and carnivals and cheese (and horrible men with egos in their guns like the Fiennes voiced Quartermaine). But when it strikes best, it's one of the most entertaining films of 2005. It gives me a big goofy smile anytime it's on TV.",1.0
5816,"Better?  Maybe.  Spectacular?  Hardly.; HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS hits theaters this week-end and, as the devoted Potter-er that I am, I was determined to see it as soon as possible. My opinion? Well.... The child acting has matured-most particularly that of Daniel Radcliffe who, reprising his role as the title protagonist, appears more at ease in front of the camera the second time round.  His timing periodically staggers slightly, but in general his portrayal of Harry has improved (the viewer should realize that due to his abusive past, Harry isn't SUPPOSED to be unduly expressive).  Emma Watson is appropriately sprightly as pal Hermione; however, Rupert Grint-so memorable in the previous film-has lost some of his snarky wit and charisma inherent in the first movie.  The fault partially falls upon the actor (one can only stand so many terrified expressions) but also onto the script, which seems to highlight Ron as a perpetual coward. The adult cast can sport some of cinema's greats, including the late Richard Harris, Dame Maggie Smith, Robbie ColtraneÂ….but, sadly, they were mostly underused.  A special mention must be conferred upon Kenneth Branaugh's narcissistic Lockhart and to Jason Isaac's deliciously malicious Lucius Malfoy.  Alan Rickman, who proved to be such a superb addition to the cast, was heinously underused as Snape and is especially missed, being one of the most fascinating characters of the series. Aesthetically, the film succeeds splendidly.  Especially the set designs were spectacular-from the castle, to the forest, to the chamber of secrets itself.  But without a solid base, the movie cannot remain steady. The pacing is where the film truly stumbles.  The first movie was apt at slowing down its brisk pace at the suitable moments, at once giving the audience a chance to breath and, more importantly, adding a touch of human element where it was needed, an element sorely lacking the second movie. The second movie tends to over-emphasize the action sequences and replace character development and plot progression with more unnecessary action (the car's aerobatics with the train). The so-called `plot' in the movie simply plods from one action sequence to the next-most of which have little to do with the actual plot itself.  I felt little continuity in the plot.  The series of events only drag us through the movie's two-hour, forty-five minute time until we suddenly find ourselves at the rushed climax, which-lo and behold-seems to serve only as another excuse to stick in some more action. Rather than leaving the theater happy, the movie left me with a sense of dissatisfaction and left me thinking, `What happened to the story?' I'm looking forward to the upcoming movie, though.  I'm definitely keen to see how another director will handle the books.  Columbus' clumsy directing coupled with Steve Kloves' jerky, bungling script seriously detract from the film. It's an entertaining little film.  Your kids will love it.  But if you're looking for something with plot and character development, look elsewhere.  You might find greater enchantment in the books themselves.",0.0

This is one of those rare movies which is intelligent while being believable at the same time. The entire concept can be quite mind boggling for a first time viewer but once you watch it, you will want to watch it again. It also helps if you have a basic understanding of Computer science and Artificial Intelligence as the entire movie revolves around these two themes.

903,"A great suspenseful film; Having seen Psycho I thought I had seen Hitchcock's best film. This film compares favourably. Vertigo has a great cast, Jimmy Stewart, and Kim Novak. Set in San Francisco with beautiful scenery, a plot unravels where you will be drawn in, and hooked to the conclusion. This is a suspenseful film from beginning to end. This is beautifully filmed, from the camera work, to the use of colour, and the film score adds greatly to the drama. This is a thrilling and clever film. The characters are whole and interesting, and Stewarts performance is compelling, and really marks him as one of the great actors. Kim Novak puts in a performance that is one of the best leads I've seen by a female actress. All round this is a wonderful, delightful film, with a in depth look at the human psyche, that has a strong resonance. Doesn't get a 10 because, i'm a film buff and very stingy.",0.0

But hey, it's a fun ride even in it's simplicity. The movie is just over an hour long, and while I wanted to see more; The short run-time only means that it didn't outstay it's welcome and the pacing was more than adequate. Exposition was given to us in acceptable doses. The characters were given a minimum of characterization, just enough to realize, and remember that there ARE indeed souls behind those clockwork eyes. Which, again, I'd like to see more of them. Perhaps even a sort of prequel (Which would omit the naive friend-killing 9) with the other 8 (And possibly finagle a few more in whatever plug-in plot you wish, even I can think of a few to justify more sackdolls).

296,"Adventurous and Highly Rewarding Film Making; Or, My Dinner With Andre the Hitman. This is a gangster movie, but in no way could it be anything like an appeal to the usual gangster movie market.  It is a completely unleashed experience with a plot so loose as to nearly vanish.  I'm almost tempted to call it an art film, but it succeeds at so many more levels that the description does not cover it. The cinematography is especially rich and fun to watch.  The lighting is natural even to the point of compromising some shots, but it all works.  Spike Lee has gone places like this and beyond, but he is much more delicate when it comes to plots and dialogues.  Perhaps he is simply no match for Travolta or Willis on screen.  But maybe he is a coconspirator, because Tarentino shows up in a role too.  It is the only weak point in the film and it's not too weak.  It draws a deserving smirk from our two hitmen.  It's all in the spirit of the film which is as much fun as you can expect from a gangster movie.  That is to say, not too much, but enough to motivate a good story.",0.0

2571,"Awesome!; The Matrix is probably the most visually stunning film I have ever seen. The fight scenes simply take your breath away, and leave you in a state of wonder.  The slow-motion filming of the gun battle scenes is of first class proportion.  As stunning as this film is visually, the story is of the highest class, spun out over two and a half hours or so, blending in perfectly within the films context, that being action/sci-fi.  Despite the complexity of the film, it was surprisingly easy to follow, the reason for that fact lies in the majestic storytelling that is conjured within The Matrix.  One word to describe this film would have to be awesome.  Don't even think, just go see, and be amazed.  I promise you will not regret it.

5816,"A fantastic sequel in all meanings of the word; As with it's predecessor, this film is fantastic (in all meanings of the word). This is one of those rare films where a sequel meets or exceeds the film it succeeds. The cast (as with the last film) are truly outstanding in their roles. The casting director really deserves a LOT of the credit for the success of these films. Even the bit actors and actresses are exceptional. One sad note is that this will be the last Harry Potter Film with the current cast. Richard Harris (who played Albus Dumbledore) passed away recently, Chris Columbus (the director) has decided to withdraw from the series and the 'in crowd' buzz is that the trio of child-stars who starred in the first two films have reached puberty and will be too old to maintain the believability of the character ages for the third and remaining novels and will be replaced in the remaining films. If this is true, I would be reluctant to see the remaining films as I've become so enamored of the current cast and cannot imagine enjoying a ""Bewitched Darren moment"" when cast members suddenly change without in-plot reason and the audience is asked to pretend it hasn't happened in a film series as good as this one has proven to be. The CGI is again outstanding. The effects vary from the utterly blatant (giant spiders, ghosts, magic, and a frightening basilisk) to the subtle (moving pictures on the wall, tattered owls, and a red-eyed cat) and convey just what they are supposed to without overwhelming one with the ""HEY! LOOK AT THIS!"" presentation of most big budget special effects. This movie runs 2 hrs and 50 min. so don't drink the kidney-buster soda before the film begins. There is no nudity, and no conventional American profanity, but there are some pretty frightening scenes with the giant spiders and the basilisk and some creepy corridor scenes that might frighten younger viewers. It might be a good idea to leave the pre-schoolers home if they are easily scared or prone to nightmares. Overall, this film is a great sequel and should not be missed by fans of the first film. While seeing the first film is not absolutely necessary to enjoy the second, it does add a LOT of information that the second film takes for granted the audience is already familiar with. If you have not seen the first film, it would be well worth your time (and a lot of fun regardless) to watch the first film before going to see the second. Go see Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. It's as good or better than the original film and it picks up right where the last one left off in fun, quality and enjoyability.",0.0
296,"Some films should be seen in a theater, this is one of them.; If this film isn't making you smile or at least listen attentively as if you were in on a private, candid conversation, then it's knocking you on your butt, flooring you with some gripping scene or perhaps a slightly confusing yet pleasing turn in editing schematic. Unless of course, you're my mother and are offended by the language and/or violence and stop watching. I remember walking out of the theater with my friend thinking I'd just seen something amazing and that I'd never seen anything like it before. I still remember the riveting, tense feeling I had when Butch, played by Bruce Willis decides to go back for his father's gold watch at his apartment, certain that gangsters like John Travolta's Vincent Vega are looking for him. The long walk to his apartment through the back alleyways and yards was incredibly tense, as you got the feeling the man was walking into certain death. And then the moment he thinks everything is fine, he decides to toast a pop tart. I thought my heart was going to burst out of my chest. And later still, when you think everything is fine again, you're floored by another predicament. The only time this sort of experience works in my opinion, is when you see a good movie for the first time in a theater. Naturally, the second time round does not produce the same kind of tension, unless of course you suffer from amnesia and don't remember what happens. But what I'm getting at is the relationship you develop with a film in a theater versus at home on video. For me, Pulp Fiction is just one example of many where the experience was vastly enhanced by the cinematic environment.",0.0
66097,"Coraline was an interesting, if not truly thrilling, suspenseful stop-motion animated film; With Henry Selick as the director, you know, the man behind Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, I expected a special treat when I watched Coraline especially in 3-D. Don't get me wrong, I did like the images that were presented throughout the movie in the rare stop-motion animation style in an era where everything else that's animated is usually done by computer. And there were interesting characters that made one want to get involved for the whole picture. It's just that after a while, there seemed more style and not enough substance to really keep you involved in the story with your eyes and ears thinking awesome the whole time but your heart wondering if there could have been more to the characterizations. In fact, since this was based on a novel, I'm sure there were some cuts that had to be made to make a certain running time. But like I said, while there wasn't enough intensity to make this truly thrilling, Coroline still was pretty exciting at certain points and many young children watching this will not get bored when the climax comes.

527,"My Favourite Film; Schindler's List is my favourite film of all time. The film is based on the novel Schindler's Ark, which itself was based on the life of Oscar Schindler who saved over 1,000 Jews during the Holocaust. Oscar Schindler was played by Liam Neeson, and his performance was excellent. The shows that Schindler himself was faulted character himself, he was a member of the Nazi, he was a war-profiteer, a womaniser and bribed officials. He did however have a sense of humanity and could not allow innocent people die. He uses his influence and money to save them and has to battle Nazi officials to do this. Ralph Fiennes was also performed brilliantly as Amon Goth, a senior Nazi who was sent to help organisation the Final Solution. Goth was portrayed a Sadistic murderer who enjoyed randomly killing Jews and having sexual affairs. It was also shown that Schindler had to work with Goth to save as many Jews as he did. As well as the acting, the black and white filming added to the atmosphere of the film. It gave the film a sense of beauty and also gives the viewer the feeling of being there. The film also shows how the horrible the Holocaust was and showed some of the things people had to do to stay alive. But it also shows the faith of many of Jews and strengthen their resolve against the Nazis. I find the Holocaust interesting on a Historical, Psychological and Sociological viewpoint because it shows mankind at its worst. It was the worst atrocity in the 20th Century and unfortunately Genocides still are going on. The ending was very touching for me as well. Some people have criticised it but I don't know why. I felt the level of emotion was just right, not over done or underplayed. It is the only time I ever been tearful during a film and that is why I think the ending works. I also like the use of real footage at the end of the film. The film as serves as a film lesson which is very good, especially since I am a History student. All in all, this film is a classic!",0.0

527,"how one man made a difference; The story of Oskar Schindler, adapted from Thomas Keneallay's book 'Schindler's Ark', was brought to the screen by Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson gives a strong and powerful performance in the lead role, bringing a dignity and gravitas to the man who saved the people on his list from certain death at the hands of the Nazis. The film is in black and white, with the exception of the red dress of a small girl we follow in the Jewish ghetto, and a real-life coda at the end where the people saved by Schindler pay their respects to him. Was Schindler a great man, a humanitarian, or motivated by gain and greed? The film seems firmly in the first camp and in its other characters portrays certain stereotypes - the sensitive Jew played by Ben Kingsley, the sadistic SS man played by Ralph Fiennes. It doesn't flinch from showing the worst of the Holocaust, and rightly so. But - as the story unfolds and the small amount of people on the list are saved - there is hope within the unspeakable terrors of anti-Semitic propaganda. Along with 'The Color Purple', this is Spielberg's strongest work.",0.0

2571,"A modern classic. In 1999 it wasn't just a movie, it was an experience.; It seems that every few decades we rebel against conformity, against established traditions. The 20's, the 60's and 70's are some examples that come to mind, and of course the 90's.  Beginning with cartoons like Tiny Toons and Animaniacs and the Simpsons, which were more honest, and more cynical animated programs than had ever been seen before, and movies like the Silence of the Lambs which irrevocably altered the serial killer movie genre, pop culture was almost self consciously fixated on bending the rules. Everything from the bizarre ending of the Thomas Harris novel Hannibal (altered for a traditonal moral finale in the 2001 movie adaptation-see we're back to square one now, the cycle has come to an end and is restarting...), to movies like American Beauty,Fight Club, Pleasantville (a '98 release), and of course the Matrix were not harmonious accidents, but the inevitable outgrowth of what began in the early nineties. A movement away from self delusion, innocence, and simplicity (which had given rise to widespread jaded cynism, and then gradually the realization that something really had to be DONE about the damaging flaws in our society). So what was expected to be another Keanu Reeves sci-fi action flick (following his last effort Johny Mnemonic, 1995) turned out instead to be a magnificent fusion of the Terminator, Kung Fu, S & M, Bullet Time (once upon a time known as the Gap Commercial effect), anime,  and cyberpunk fiction, overlaid with elements of a Western, film noir, and philosophy. At its core though, its a story of triumphant rebellion against established authority. The Wachowski Brothers quite rightly, imo, acknowledge that social conformity is a mental handicap that keeps many of us from achieving either our full potential, or what we truly desire in life, thus it is no surprise that the Matrix is described as something that you feel ""when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes."" Keanu Reeves even jokingly labled his character a hippie (see The Matrix Revisted, 2001),and the movie certainly is harking back to those old attitudes( but again, the anti-establishment feelings our society gets caught up in is cyclical, the feelings must be, because if they were to continue to their logical end without stopping we would all be plunged into anarchy. Still,its nice to spread our wings and fly every once in awhile). Its this surprising social relevancy which imo, helped vaunt this film into the top of the sci fi heap in what was supposed to be the year of the Star Wars: Phantom Menace (ironically what was supposed to year of the Matrix, four years later, ended in bitter disappointment for Matrix fans. Now they know how Lucas fans felt, I suppose). Now for the record, yes the pseudoscience is rubbish and flies in the face of thermodynamics, but it doesn't matter. The pseudo science was also rubbish in the classic tale ""Dr. Jekyll and Mister Hyde"", and was openly acknowledged as such by author Robert Louis Stevenson. What matters is what the story is trying to say. Its not an especially original movie, from the perspective of plot, or visua ls. Even the iconic green computer code opening credits are stolen from Ghost in the Shell (from were we also have the image of people with electrical conduits in the back of their necks).  The scenes were Neo learns that his life was lie recalls scenes in Ghost in the Shell where people are devastated to learn that a sentient computer known as the  Puppetmaster has hacked into their brains and implanted false memories, in order to use them for his own purposes (or for that matter the work of sci-fi legend Phillip K. Dick-an acknowledged influence on the brothers- in particular tales like ""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank"" which was the basis for the movie ""Total Recall""). The movie also has some visual cribs from The Terminator (the sun glasses and leather, although I must say it's done much better here), and Se7en (although the dimly lit hallways in this movie are given a cool green tint. Sadly dingy, atmospheric environments are almost entirely absent in the next movie). ""The Matrix"", ""Jacking In"", and ""Zion"" are names and phrases taken from the 1984 book Neuromancer by William Gibson, with which the Matrix's story certainly has some interesting parallels. The basic plot of Neuromancer is as follows: Case is a hacker who has lost his ability to connect to  an interconnected system of computers known as the Matrix as the result of a deal-gone-bad. He is all but down and out, running drugs and other particularly risky transactions; he appears to have a death wish. Just as he almost bottoms out, he meets the beautiful but lethal Molly Millions who claim to be able to restore his ability to access the matrix. In the Matrix, Neo is a hacker who sells narcotic software who is haunted by the enigmatic nature of something called the Matrix (and so the now famous phrase ""What is the Matrix?"" is born). when he meets the beautiful but lethal Trinity who claims to know the answer to his question. Despite this grab bag of ""borrowed"" ideas, the film that emerged had its own unique identity. An undercurrent of sado masochism runs throughout the film, with its emphasis on control, slavery, subjugation and domination. Its only fitting in this S and M fairytale context that the hero is a mostly passive wimp who must ultimately be rescued by a leather clad biker girl in climatic scene that plays like a modern Sleeping Beauty (inevitably the man plays the role of Beauty). Trinity is the second in a line of tough, haunted women with unsual names and a fondness for leather and sunglasses (see Bound, 1996). Although she has striking similarities to Molly Millions, I have to say that in the end, she is definitely a ""Wachowski-an"" character first and foremost. Given that the Wachowski's first movie celebrated lesbian love, it is interesting to note the gender role reversal in the romantic relationship b/t Neo and Trinity. Neo is very clearly the female (in the sequel, Matrix Reloaded, it is he who is revealed as the needy one, calling out to Trinity as she leaves), and in fact not unlike so many of the passive, put upon heroines of 1950s Disney movies who have to be rescued by friends (singing mice for example) from a life of subjugation to cruel authority figures. The maligned climatic kiss then becomes much more appropriate seen in that light. The Wachowski's also give us one of cinema's greatest villains in the form of the sneering Agent Smith. He's at his sinister best in the original, as he could send a chill down your spine with a single well timed smirk, and always speaking as if he was talking to a small child he didn't like (as one reviewer put it). Unfortunately his menace fades as he became more human in the sequels. Emotion is the enemy of Agents (something confirmed by reading the original screenplay); any sign of anger or frustration on their part is a sign of weakness. Sadly its a hambone joy at his own villany in the sequels which proves to be the undoing of Agent Smith, but nevermind. In this movie he is one helluva cool baddie. The movie also gets a lot of mileage out of Christian mythology (with Morpheus playing something like John the Baptist to Neo's Jesus) buddhist principles of mind over matter (you can will yourself to leap tall buildings in a single bound), and the allegory of Plato's cave (a model used to illustrate why it is important for humans to achieve reflective understanding), Descartes (who tells us that the only thing we can trust to be real and irrefutable are mathematical principles),  and some rather glaring, unsubtle symbolism (like naming Lawrence Fishburne's character after Morpheus, the Greek god who could enter dreams and change their shape), but most viewers will simply view it as a great action movie with a ball busting opener, that segues into a slow second act, before going crazy with action again at the end. Speaking of which, the ending though considered weak and more like the intro to a television series (not unlike the ending for X-Men),  was for my money immensley satisfying because even though it was left open to accomodate last year's sequels, Neo was revealed to be the One, and victory was assured ( Billy Wilder once said that whether a story has a happy ending or a sad ending depends on were you chose to end it, and this certainly would have been a much more rousing finale to the story, imo). It is the Quentin Taratino of sci fi movies, in that it blends disparate elements into a cohesive and stunning new whole that emerges as a true original. Although I enjoyed the flawed sequels (which deepend the world of the Matrix, but not the characters), it was inevitable that they wouldn't run on the same delirious anarchic juice as the original, those feelings reached their dramatic crescendo in 99'. It was 2003, a different world, where terrorism is afoot in the world and a time for a return to normalcy (so politicians say). I suppose ultimately maturity is learning to cope and compromise with the authority figures hovering over you in life, rather than obliterating them in an orgy of bullet shells and kung fu kicks. That (unfortunate?) fact of life became the point of the Matrix trilogy, and one of the reasons that it turned off so many fans who went in with a definite ""destroy the machines"" bent. *sigh* It's not the nineties anymore, and I-whoops, its time for me to get back to work...",0.0

Or when Shaun is walking towards a shop. It's also funny to see how Coldplay was involved in this project, back then in 2004 they weren't the mega seller they are nowadays. The effects on the other hand were excellent, just see how one zombie got a whole in her stomach. And not only the humor was okay but the gore staid intact too. There are a few better comedies out there but this one worked on all kind, script, make-up, effects and especially the editing. The two main leads (nick Frost and Simon Pegg) went further as the Thomson twins in Tintin by Steven Spielberg. Surely on to see if you want to have some fun.

2571,"An Actually Great Film; I was hesitant to approach this film, as it seemed like a pointless, overblown action film. Maybe it is all that, but it is also a great film, and perhaps the most important film since The Battleship Potemkin. It has a deceptively simple plot. Just another apocalyptic robot rebellion. Still, it not only draws on biblical and mythological stories, but it creates the fascinating concept of the Matrix. It blurs reality lines between the various worlds in play, and uses all the implications of artificial reality to its advantage in great visual innovation. The Matrix used CGI and bullet-time in never-before-seen ways that have already become clichÃ©d. It came at the end of a 20-year innovation starved era of film, and shocked the world with something new. Who could forget Neo and Smith diving at each other, their guns blazing? Who could forget Neo leaning backwards, dodging bullets, sharing the screen with objects moving at impossible speeds, but somehow making us forget that they were bullets? Perhaps most stunning of all: who could forget Neo, to Uzis blazing, straight in front of him, as he runs, cloak trailing, through a hell of flying tiles and marble as untold numbers of bullets fly around him? These unforgettable moments are the excuse for such overblown action. Finally, it is worth mentioning that this film has one of the most perfect villains ever to grace the screen. A demented but calm, crazed but intelligent, ruthless but calculated agent known as Smith laughs, yells, and taunts his way through his great lines filled with pregnant pauses. A perfect villain for a messiah of a hero.",0.0
296,"This film has many of today's big actors and actresses.; This film has many of today's big actors and actresses. Vincent Vega, who was played by John Travolta, and Jules Winnfield, played by Samuel L Jackson, are hit-men that are hired by the mobster Marsellus Wallace, played by Ving Rhames. However, after a shooting Jules Winnfield decides to remove himself from the gangster life. Shortly after Winnfield left the gangster life Vega is assigned my Wallace to take is wife out for the night to do whatever she wanted to do. The night ended at the Wallace house where Mia, played by Uma Thurman, overdosed on drugs. Criminal activity, money, and drugs seems to be the theme of this film. At the film we see the gangsters, Winnfield and Vega killing three people in what looks to be an apartment, and throughout the rest of the film we see flashbacks of criminal activity involving the two gangsters. We see in several scenes where mobster Wallace hires different people to perform certain activities, we see the money be transferred from the hands of Wallace to each character performing, in most cases, illegal activity. Lastly, the drugs in Pulp Fiction are a constant in the film. We see several instances where Vega is doing a drug. We also see Mia Wallace overdose on drugs and almost lost her life. This movie reminds me of the film The Way of the Gun made in 2000. The two films have a lot of criminal activity throughout the movie and it is all for one thing. The money. Characters in both films seem to be extremely greedy, and are willing to do just about anything, including killing people and kidnapping a young adult, to make a quick extra dollar. Vincent Vega's flashbacks in the movie, I thought, really added to the movie. We can see the type of relationship Vega had with Jules Winnfield. To me the flashbacks show the greatness the team of Vega and Winnfield had. I thought Vega wasn't as great of a gangster as he looked to be when he was working with Winnfield before he left the business. I also felt the camera angles in this film could have been better. One scene that stuck out the most to me with the camera angles was with Butch Coolidge we only see him talking and the back of Marsellus Wallace's head. To me this scene was a bit boring because we the camera was only on Coolidge. In order to be more effective I think the camera should have gone back and forth between Coolidge and Wallace for the viewer to really feel interested in the scene.",0.0
48385,"Lame Humor; The success of this movie just shows how hypocrite people get excited by watching racial, female, and non-American bashing. When people don't understand other cultures, they make fun of them, implying that their own culture is far more superior than of those they make fun of. If all the fun is made on the expense of one nation (and its not sarcasm like Simpsons, and its not US), then gee I wonder why the world hates us. Borat is an idiot from Khazakistan, and he makes sure that he gets the worst out of people by acting crazy in front of them.

6537,"lots of fun, though no T2; If you go into this expecting a fun action picture that is not going to be at the level of the first two movies, you'll probably have a good time.  There are some fun action scenes, a fair amount of amusing jokes referring to the previous movie and a really hot evil robot played by a model whose vacuous model stare works perfectly in the role. But no, it's not as good as the first two.  Those movies moved like lightening, moving at a breakneck speed that kept you from catching your breath.  T2 was a thrill ride from beginning to end, and T3 never works up that sort of momentum.  Its holes are easier to pick at than the previous movies (although not terrible by action movie standards) and the ending is downright disappointing.  But if rather than comparing it with two of the best action films ever made, you compare it with more typical action flicks, it's superior to many, a good but not great movie that is energetic fun most of the time with some terrific moments here and there.  Yes, it would have been better directed by James Cameron rather than some director so obscure that I don't know how he finagled the job, but it's still effectively directed.  Just lower your expectations a little bit and watch it.",0.0
6537,"James Cameron is Missed; From beginning to end you could say this movie is missing all the things that made T2 such a remarkable movie in 1991. The artistic style of James Cameron is gone, replaced with a dizzying fast-paced shoot-em-up.  The character development that played such an important role in T2 and T1 is missing.  It's replaced with a quick intro about a neurotic man named John Conner, and a stereotypical daddy's girl who has a hotshot father in a secret military facility. The whole anticipation of the Terminators finding John Conner is missing, replaced with a quick cut into a vet's office where ironically both Terminators find John Conner and Punky Brewster...err I mean Kate Brewster. After that point, there isn't much time for explanation, it's just shoot this, shoot that, leading to a bland ending that could be used to milk the series for another few summers. This movie was completely half-assed by directors, writers, and producers who weren't interested in reliving one of the James Cameron's greatest movie series of all time, but just using the name to sell tickets so they can suck the series dry before Arnold gets too old.

903,"Not as great as they say but fun to watch; Vertigo is a mystery film in the late 50s that has a way of luring you in till you become hooked to see how it is all going to turn out. I love the nice twist in the ending that makes you know that all that you are watching is just a setup that is if you have not read the book prior to watching this classic. Although many a classics have been made, Vertigo has received many praises which I believe it does not deserve. Viewers may be bored by the lengthy drama, but if you are the kind that loves to see how it is going to turn out, then Vertigo is a movie for you. The film stars James Stewart as former police detective John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, who had to retire due to disabilities (vertigo and clinical depression) incurred when a police colleague died trying to save him. Scottie gets a call from an old friend who hires him as a private investigator to follow his wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) who is behaving strangely. Scottie begins the job which led to him falling in love and becoming obsessed with his work. The screenplay is an adaptation of the French novel The Living and the Dead (D'entre les morts) by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac. Although Vertigo is fun to watch, it may be a bore at times and has so many loose ends. Some of the times the camera angles were weird, the use of the zoom to play out the vertigo feeling is to be praised though. Well if you are ready to sit 2 hours for a movie to thrill ya, then vertigo is it. If not try something else.",0.0

I had lots of fun enjoying the making of the puppets and movie. Great art direction. Great soundtrack.

8874,"Surprisingly good zombie comedy; Zombie apocalypse as joke material is really nothing new. In broad daylight the slow and mumbling undead are actually pretty pathetic sight as long as you don't let them get too close. I still don't think that the subject matter has ever been approached quite this way. Because when you really look at it, in Shaun of the Dead, the zombies aren't the source of the comedy, they're actually a credible threat to the everyday joes that inhabit this film. Rather most of the humour in this film stems from the sheer stupidity of mankind. Because let's face it, many of us wouldn't make it for a day if the gates of hell were to be opened. But there would be some individuals, who against all odds would survive through sheer dumb luck. And that's this film. The director, Edgar Wright, along with the two main actors, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, would later go on to make Hot Fuzz, one of my favourite comedies of all time, and a lot of the same ideas show up in this film. The same bland non-interest in the face of danger, bizarre circumstances happening in the background and the absolutely brilliant interaction between Pegg and Frost are the saving graces of this film, along with the usual zombie jokes that you'd expect from a film like this. This isn't Hot Fuzz, however, though it's still rather good. What I think it misses are likable main characters. The main characters in this film are really, really urban and bland. They're so boring and so lost in their everyday lives, not to mention the zombie apocalypse, that it's hard to root for them. I found myself cheering for the zombies occasionally when some of the more obnoxious characters were killed. Whether or not this was intentional, I don't know, but it does the film no favours. That's my personal interests interfering with my viewing experience, though, because I've never really liked these kinds of characters that are so helpless and so socially awkward that even the local computer nerds pick on them. Some might find them hilarious, however, so I can't really call it a flaw of the film. It's just not something that appeals to me. Aside from that grievance, the film is very good. The plot twists are very unexpected, but in a good way, the action scenes are not bad and the story, while a bit weird in some parts, manages to work, for some incomprehensible reason. Any fan of zombie parody should definitely give this one a watch.",0.0
2302,"A solid and enjoyable comedy vehicle for Mr. Pesci.; ""My Cousin Vinny"" is an engaging, funny movie that if nothing else shows us just how talented Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei are. It's a superb showcase. The movie itself is an interesting case in how an amazing coincidence could serve to screw over two basically innocent guys. It would seem at first to be basically a one joke comedy - take an Italian American and drop him into the deep South - but it's developed in an entertaining way and has some real heart and charm going for it - although it does go on a bit long. Pesci stars in the tailor-made role of Vinny Gambini, a so-called ""lawyer"" who needed six tries in order to pass the bar exam. He's thrust into the unlikely position of defending his college age cousin Bill (Ralph Macchio) when Bill and his buddy Stan (Mitchell Whitfield) are accused of murdering the clerk at a convenience store. With his fiancÃ©e Mona Lisa Vito (a radiant Tomei) in tow, Vinny finds adjusting to life in the South - and adhering to the strict procedures of its courts - to be a struggle. Pesci and the Oscar winning Tomei are lots of fun to watch, and have fine chemistry with each other. They receive fine support from a well chosen bunch of actors. Macchio and Whitfield don't have much to do once Pesci enters the picture, but prove to be reasonably likable. (Macchios' character Bill, however, isn't too bright.) Top notch character actors Lane Smith (as the prosecutor), Austin Pendleton (as a stuttering public defender), Maury Chaykin, James Rebhorn, and Raynor Scheine (as witnesses), and Bruce McGill (as the sheriff) all do fine work. Fred Gwynne has some great moments as the stern, disapproving judge who doesn't care for Vinnys' way of doing things. Serious at times but never too, too serious, ""My Cousin Vinny"" knows how to end big, and send us away with smiles on our faces. It's worth noting that Jonathan Lynn, the director, is British, adding to the overall sense of the outsider perspective. Seven out of 10.",0.0
4886,"Monsters, Inc., A quirky twist on the interactions between monsters and humans; This family-friendly animation takes place in the world of monsters. At Monsters, Inc., the monsters enter doors, leading to the closets of children on a quest to scare as many of them as possible to fill up energy tanks that help keep their city powered. As with many companies, Monsters, Inc. keeps track of top performers, thus invoking a competitive spirit amongst the monster employees. Things change when Sullivan, also known as Sulley (voiced by John Goodman) stumbles upon a little girl named Boo (voiced by Mary Gibbs) and is forced to face and perhaps overcome his fears. Sulley is the top scarer and has been for many months. His best friend Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal) stays close by helping him stay in top performer shape, though he sometimes gets sidetracked by his romantic interest, receptionist Celia (voiced by Jennifer Tilly). Sulley's fiercest competition comes from Randall (voiced by Steve Buscemi) who will do whatever he can, with some help from his sidekick Fungus (voiced by Frank Oz), to snag the top spot from Sulley, including cheating. Humans, primarily children, are a feared species, so when Boo, who Randall has a lot of success frightening, enters Monsters, Inc., it changes Sulley's life forever. Initially, Sulley is afraid and does everything he can to get rid of Boo. As Sulley gets to know her, over the course of time, he becomes less fearful and even turns into Boo's protector. Eventually, Sulley learns that his fear, along with the other monsters, of children is misguided and over exaggerated due to lack of knowledge. This makes me think of the movie Inside Out and how our emotions can lead us astray if we don't keep them in check. Once Sulley gains some insight, his new awareness ultimately leads to a delightful change in how business is conducted at Monsters, Inc. There were shadowy effects throughout the film which added a sense of suspense. However, the lighting on Sulley is soft, which gave warmth to his character, even though he's one of the largest monsters. The transitions from scene to scene were smooth. The music effects are suspenseful, happy and playful in the right areas. The attention to detail in all sectors made the movie thrive. I really enjoyed Monsters, Inc. I would rank it as one of my favorite animated movies. The writing is funny and witty, and the props are clever. I look forward to watching it again. It was a nice spin on overcoming fears and not judging a book by its cover. Two lessons that are universal and relatable to all ages, races, and genders.",0.025
527,"A work of art.; Schindler's List is one of those movies that elicits such a strong reaction not only the first time one sees it, but every subsequent time that people often respond without fully being able to think through what they are saying. Personally, it is one of my favorites, as I have emerged from each viewing of it exhausted, torn, and enlightened from an experience explores many sides of humanity during one of the most terrifying times in recent history. Some, however, have responded very negatively to what they term historical inaccuracies, lack of focus on the real issues, or for others, overblown sentimentality.  Not being Spielberg, I have no idea what his intentions were, but I would argue that no single movie can ever truly capture the experience of an entire continent during a six year period or war, much less a 13 year period of Nazi rule in Germany.  Regardless of how incredible Schindler's List is, it should only be the first of many Holocaust movies to be made.  Thus, I agree with people who argue that there was more to the Holocaust than this film, but to not recognize the greatness of this film for that reason is simply ridiculous.  This movie explores human nature, therein lies its true greatness.  It asks each and every one of us to search the depths of our character, and ask ourselves what we would do in a situation where our moral, spiritual, and physical beings were threatened from every direction.  Do we really expect film to be reality?  I don't.  I go to movies to make me think, to make me look inward and learn something about myself, to tell explore a part of reality that I had not ever seen before.  Schindler's List does exactly this better than almost any other film through nearly flawless acting, beautiful cinematography, and a fantastic story, historically accurate or not.  I don't want to relive the Holocaust, I consider myself quite fortunate that I have never had, and hopefully never will have, to make the decisions facing either Stern, Goethe, or Schindler.  Instead, the Holocaust should be taught and learned about to discover more about humanity, hopefully to reach an understanding of ourselves that we can use in the future. That's what this film does; it's a work of art.",0.0

I fail to see why so many people actually like this film, and why it continues to get great reviews. The only thing this film offers is a lot of graphic violence and blood throughout the entire movie (the only thing that Quentin Tarantino is good for).

2571,"Too much fun.; This is the film that everyone is flocking to, and with good reason. I cannot recall when I have had so much fun at a movie. Usually big blockbusters like this put me off because the need for special effects eclipses good acting and writing. Fortunately, as a pleasant surprise, this wasn't like that. Yes, Keanu Reeves still cannot act, but Laurence Fishburne and especially Carrie-Ann Moss make the movie work on that level.. The story is way out-of-this-world. A computer crook seeks the answer to the question ""What is the Matrix?"", and finds it. What he finds out is that his reality is not actually reality itself. The story gets more complicated than that, and as far as Science Fiction goes, this is as good as it gets. The Special Effects are spectacular. To say the very least. There is plenty of fighting (Keanu's facial gestures during the fight scenes are hysterical), shooting, cool weapons, and some awe-inspiring effects shots to arouse the interest of almost any moviegoer. And all the characters look especially cool in their dark clothes and custom sunglasses. For me, the best parts of the movie were with Carrie-Ann Moss. She is definitely the character every one liked the most in ""The Matrix"". This is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you breathless. A guaranteed good time.",0.0
48385,"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan - my positive review on the mockumentary-comedy.; Dodgy, surreal mockumentary-comedy that's been both criticised and praised - Yes, that is the film 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' directed by Larry Charles and starring Sacha Baron Cohen, who plays the role of Borat Sagdiyev, a travelling journalist making his way from Kazakhstan to the United States of America. Borat Sagdiyev travels to America with his producer Azamat Bagatov and a pet chicken. When they get there, they're somewhat worried and scared. Borat comes across Actress Pamela Anderson, whom he intends to marry after he quickly and immediately falls in love with her and after he hears that his wife has been killed by a dear. At that point, Borat tries to convince Azamat Bagatov that California is a good place to go because ""Pearl Harbor is there."" He succeeds with his lie, and they travel there - Borat only wants to go there to marry Pamel (whom he saw whilst watching BayWatch.) Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is one of the funniest, although very controversial. Nonetheless, the humour, the characters and the obscene and odd moments will make you laugh until your hearts jumps out of your chest to laugh with you. It's a good film (despite the criticism and religious views.) Accusations of racism and bans have came about the film, and I honestly understand why, but nevertheless, it's, overall, a great film. The character Borat himself is rather likable, idiotic and entertaining, as stupid as he may be - and you will see just how stupid he is in some parts of the film. The film received widespread critical acclaim, with it being praised for its performances, humour and a lot more. Last but not least, it's been rated and marked as one of the greatest comedies of all-time, with positive comments and ratings from loads of other critics and fans alike. I rate Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan a strong 8.5/10.",0.0
2571,"The Matrix & The brains in a vat; The Matrix is a really complex movie in which every names and sentences have their metaphoric meanings. Until I was explained about the movie, I didn't really understand it,honestly it was simply kung fu! However,I can see now its truly depth. The philosophic idea ""Brains in a vat"" says that we can never be aware whether we are human beings with corpse and mind who live in our lovely planet, or single minds connected to computers that send to our brains all the information to cause on us feelings and emotions. By taking in consideration the latter explanation we fall into a skepticism since we have no idea of how we can find the truth, moreover, we've no idea which reality is the truth. This idea is also quite similar to Descarte's malin gÃ©nie. According to the philosopher we can't be sure of anything since there is a sort of an evil genius capable of making us falling into mistake and also willing to do it. In this case the Evil Genius (aka malin gÃ©nie) has the same role as the computers in ""Brains in a vat"". The movie The Matrix explores the same idea. Thomas Anderson (Neo) was a computer hacker who thought to be living in a real world. However, Morpheus and his crew come to the fantasy world (called the Matrix) to rescue him. In this recent version the human beings are prisoners of Artificial Intelligence in order to supply energy to the machines. Humans are connected to computers who integrate them in a fantasy world or a dream called The Matrix. The machines are the computers and the Evil genius simultaneously who make us living in dream. After Morpheus rescuing Neo (anagram for the ONE), he explains him how Matrix works and how to survive inside it: the more you believe it doesn't the exist, more are the rules you are capable of breaking. If you believe you're living your own dream you can do whatever you want. This is how Neo learns Kong Fu, stop bullets and reborns after being killed. This idea is also present in the classic Alice in Wonderland. After some research I started understanding most of the movie but the Smits were still a mystery for me... I didn't take much longer until i figure it out. The agents are the ones who avoid people of finding the truth. As soon as someone starts to ration the agents interfer in order to kill them and keep the ignorance around. What else can we say about the movie?

1246,"A guy's weepie -- if you're into ""this kind"" of movie. Unfortunately I'm not. (And how did this ever get 38,000 votes??!!); First off let me say that I am not particularly fond of this sort of film. I feel that it has been done over and over and over again, since the major success of the formula with this film. We've seen THE EMPEROR'S CLUB, MONA LISA SMILE, SCHOOL OF ROCK, SISTER ACT, and many other rip-offs (some good, most poor) that fail to establish the warmth of this one. That's the problem -- DEAD POETS SOCIETY is all gooey; all warmth. It's well-made, and I can certainly understand why some might love it. But for me it's a bit too controlling and sentimental. Most of the characters are cliches. I had a hard time ""getting into"" the movie, and once I did, I'll admit that it became interesting -- but it's not gripping at all. It takes focus. Which is a good thing I suppose. I'm a fan of gentle, soft epics -- but this one is sugar-coated a bit too thick. It comes across as utterly unconvincing and, at times, yes, even annoying. For some reason most comedians feel they need to prove to the world that they can act. With Robin Williams, the problem is that he's not a particularly great actor, mainly because every time we hear him speak we're reminded of his early days as a comedian. There's something generally funny about the guy. I love GOOD WILL HUNTING but have a hard time taking him seriously most of the time. Every time he opens his mouth I feel like I'm supposed to laugh or something. Him playing a serial killer in INSOMNIA is admirable, but at the same time, rather laughable. He's just not the sort of guy who would have ever gotten a career through acting -- even his voice sounds comedic, and when he tries to play serious characters, he has a hard time controlling himself (see this for proof -- he's constantly acting like a hyper-active man-child). So...the acting is great and Williams DOES give a good performance, but I have a hard time taking him seriously. Peter Weir is a great director but essentially I just feel he layered this one a bit too thick with controlling, contrived sentimentality. It's a shame. NOTE: I am in no way suggesting that you will not like this movie, and am not bashing it. Don't feel the need to send me hate letters -- I recommend this film to anyone who thinks they might enjoy it. However, if you ""know"" it's not your sort of movie, chances are you WON'T like it. I liked it, but didn't love it, and had a hard time focusing most of the time, mainly because I felt distanced from what was happening. I was watching it with a girl who said, ""This is such a guy's movie,"" and left the room in disgust. Ironically I was just thinking the opposite -- ""this is such a 'chick flick'."" So I got to thinking...if this is a film targeted towards guys -- which it obviously is (it covers all ground of male trials and tribulations)...then why is it so damned ""gooey""? And as a final reflection...how on earth did this get 38,000 votes from IMDb users? I understand that it's a famous film, regarded as a well-made ""classic"" of its genre...but honestly I thought I'd see about 17,000 - 21,000 votes. 38,000 votes is close to the amount THE LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING had last time I checked. THE TERMINATOR is only 12,000 ahead, and between the two, which do YOU see referenced more in pop culture? Anyway...this is a poor review, so don't send me any hate mail -- I already know... Great acting only makes this worth recommending.",0.0
2571,"Three Movies in One; The question what is the matrix, was answered in the movie.  However, one burning question the movie did not answer was, what made Thomas Anderson/Neo the one.  I walked away from this movie of two minds.  On one hand I loved the fight/special effect sequences.  And I liked how Neo's character developed.  There was a logical progression in his skills from a novice as seen in the fight in the dojo to an accomplished master of the matrix. This progression did nothing for me but beg the question ""What made Neo special, why could he do these thing and Morphus or Trinity could not?""  My other side thought of the plot.  Now I will say it was mind-blowing enough to have to accept and understand the concept of the matrix.  I did not feel it help the movie to throw in the various subplots, such as the Oracle or the character that betrayed the group and gloated long enough for the ""wounded"" character to kill him.  And where did this whole I love you from Trinity to Neo come from.  Out of the blue if you asked me. It seemed that The Matrix borrowed heavily from three outstanding movies to make one mediocre movie.  The AI machines felt like they had been taken out of the Terminator series and the concept changed enough to make the Wachowski brothers' legally safe.  I also felt that Neo was being treated like Luke was in Star Wars.  In Star Wars, I understood what made Luke special.  Finally I feel the Matrix borrowed from Dreamscape.  Here is where I felt the plot really fell down.  Once anyone understood the concept of the Matrix, they should have been nearly invincible.  Morphus seemed to show he understood the concept, yet he could not defeat the Agents. I guess I liked the fights and the special effects, but the plot just left too many holes.",0.0
6537,"different but worthwhile; the first two terminator films are classics. so this third installment had a real good chance of ruining the whole effect. but i was actually suprised. although complex, the film actually fits with the story. and it leaves with something to think about as the end credits begin to roll. it's almost profound. it's no terminator 1, how could it be. and it's not even T-2 but i was 12 then, so nothing ever could be. but it is a damn good film. the action scenes are orchestrated just as good as cameron ever could have done. the actors are fair but nothing great. nick stahl proving the best as john conner. i suppose if you step back and look at it, it is different. john conner looks different and in a way, ruins the continuation. arnie now bears no resemblance to himself from T1, which makes it difficult to relate to the past story. but what i really missed. what i really thought should have been in the movie. was that great terminator score. not just the popular one but the theme they use during the chases of T2. if they coulda put that in over the action scenes here, it would've felt more like a terminator movie. but with these flaws, it doesnt stop you from enjoying what's on the screen. a slam bam action film that provides a thoughtful ending to the classic trilogy.",0.0
296,"One of the Best Movies of All Time; This movie is definitely one of my favorites of all time. The dialogue is great, there are many famous actors that nail their performances, and Tarantino's techniques are great. Good story line with the right amount of action and storyline. Great film. One of the best things that helps this film succeed is in the way it is told. The scenes jump around as in Quentin Tarantino's other movies. The story is told from a couple different perspectives which is good. This movie also has an amazing soundtrack. The music alone is enough to see this film. Travolta and Jackson nail their performances so well, they are very believable. Go see Reservoir Dogs, by Quentin Tarantino, as well because you will like that if you liked this one (but this is definitely better).",0.0

Masturbation. I'm surprised the bear did not end up in a sex scene but perhaps they tried and it didn't make the cut. My 13 year old daughter told me all her friends had seen this. Can you imagine?

2571,"A daily comment from Midget Emma: The Matrix (1999); The Matrix is not for everyone. Some love it, some hate it and some even dress up as Neo and Trinity and walk out in public. I am one of those people who don't care about the Matrix and thinks its nothing special. What is the Matrix? Well it was a turning point in CGI and a good Sci-Fi film. It is at times very funny as we watch Hugo Weaving saying"" Mr Anderson"" really slow or watching Keanu Reeves signing come here while in a fight. This may be best Matrix but i am no fan of the Matrix. I found it to be a mess of a trilogy. As you can tell i am not a big fan of the Matrix movies but there are good things. There are OK fights and good special effects. The story is OK also. I don't recommend it. But there is a chance you will like it. 5/10",0.0

2571,"The Matrix (1999); he Matrix is a 1999 American science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowski Brothers, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopian future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called ""the Matrix"", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer ""Neo"" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the ""dream world"". The Matrix is known for popularizing a visual effect known as ""bullet time"", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow- motion while the camera's viewpoint appears to move through the scene at normal speed. The film is an example of the cyberpunk science fiction genre.4 It contains numerous references to philosophical and religious ideas, and prominently pays homage to works such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave,5 Jean Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation6 and Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.7 The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation8 and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema was influential upon subsequent Hollywood action film productions. The Matrix was first released in the United States on March 31, 1999, and grossed over $460 million worldwide. It was generally well-received by critics,910 and won four Academy Awards as well as other accolades including BAFTA Awards and Saturn Awards. Reviewers praised The Matrix for its innovative visual effects, cinematography and its entertainment. The film's premise was both criticized for being derivative of earlier science fiction works, and praised for being intriguing. The action also polarized critics, some describing it as impressive, but others dismissing it as a trite distraction from an interesting premise. Despite this, the film has since appeared in lists of the greatest science fiction films,111213 and in 2012, was added to the National Film Registry for preservation.14 The success of the film led to the release of two feature film sequels, both written and directed by the Wachowski Brothers, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games, and animated short films in which the Wachowskis were heavily involved",0.0
71057,"Very good after the end story who's only flaw is its a tad too short; It's the end of the world and what is left is truly bleak place. Into the landscape comes 9, a rag doll like creature made by a scientist. Wandering out into the wilderness of what is left from the man/machine war he finds that he is not alone. There are 8 more like himself. Unfortunately also lurking in the wastes is a horrible monster. Sean Acker's expansion of his Oscar nominated short is a visual feat. Acker has created a very real very tactile film. This could be our world tomorrow. Looking at the eye popping landscapes one is struck not only by their bleak beauty but also by a certain amount of sadness as to what brought us here. I think for the most part the expansion works. The short, which basically concerned 9's battle with the monster is turned into something more, a struggle for survival on a larger scale. There is more drama and much more action. The film improves as it goes on as bits and pieces fall into place and tapestry of the tale becomes less and less like anything that has gone before.(For a while I thought this was going to be something similar to other films but in the end I was wrong. Likewise I was wrong about the visuals being all, there is a real story in this film's hear and the visuals are part of the way the story comes across) If there is any problems with the film, its that the film is too short. Shorn of its end credits the film is just over 70 minutes. The running time itself isn't the problem, the problem is that there are several times when the film seems to have left something out, that things have been skipped over. To the films credit the film's world bleeds off the screen and you never doubt it's a real place, but at the same time there are some bumps in the telling in the later part of the film that made it feel like Acker and his crew made a jump based on what they knew, unaware that it wasn't completely clear in the film. I can't explain it, partly because to do so would reveal plot points, and partly because its kind of hard to explain what exactly is missing. Flaws or not this is a film that needs to be seen if you like science fiction or fantasy. Its a spectacular film that really should be seen as big as possible for maximum effect. I think you really will like this. (Hell, if nothing else it may change your mind about Over the Rainbow)",0.0
66097,"Decent movie with a good message; Let's just get this out of the way I thought this movie was a bit boring. Especially the first half of it because it was quite slow and the characters weren't that interesting and throughout the movie both Coraline and (regular) Wybie were even a bit irritating. But the second half was a lot better and more entertaining. But this movie looked great, the combination between computer-animations and stop-motion really made it special and beautiful, and you can see that a lot of effort was put in to it. Although the characters weren't that interesting the voice-acting was good and I especially liked Keith David and Ian Mcshane. Overall I would give this movie 7.3.",0.0
903,"Love this flick!  Gorgeous, haunting, classic!; I recently re-discovered and fell in love with this movie. I'd seen it years before, but the first viewing didn't ""grab"" me for some reason. It's one of my favorites now, though. Some viewers complain that the plot is too convoluted, doesn't make sense, etc., but I think the best approach is not to take it too literally, if that's possible for you. Just take it as someone's dream (or nightmare). If you're after an action movie or that sort of thing, it might be best to let that mood pass before watching Vertigo. Highlights for me: the Saul Bass credits, the opening rooftop chase, the psychedelic nightmare sequence, the gorgeous Bernard Herrmann music, the eerie art gallery scene. It's all great, though.",0.0
38038,"Best animated film I've ever seen!; I've loved Wallace & Gromit since I was six years old, so I was particularly happy when I finally got to see their feature debut, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. I had to wait for some time, though, since it was released in Italy two days before the 2006 Academy Awards. Which is better, in a way, as I therefore knew I was going to see a good film, freshly awarded with the Best Animated Feature Oscar, and deservedly so. Of all the winners so far (Shrek, Spirited Away, which is the only one I still haven't viewed, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and W & G), this wonderful collaboration between Dreamworks and Aardman is the absolute best. Its main charm is the fact that, despite the bigger scope, longer running time and Hans Zimmer's contribution to the music, the film remains undeniably, deliciously British. Even the only two celebrity voices, Helena Bonham Carter and Ralph Fiennes, are pure-blood Brits, and their performances are just one of the things that make The Curse of the Were-Rabbit a modern classic. This delightful ""horror"" comedy sees Wallace, still a brilliant inventor and compulsive cheese-eater (and still voiced by Peter Sallis), and Gromit, still the one to really save the day when things get bad, embrace a huge responsibility: the two run Anti-Pesto, a company whose function is to make sure rabbits won't eat everyone's vegetables before the annual contest. The competition takes place at Tottington Hall, where Lady Campanula Tottington (Carter) lives. Wallace immediately falls for her, and vows to make sure her garden will remain untouched. Unfortunately for him, two problems are on their way: Victor Quatermaine (Fiennes), an arrogant, narcissistic hunter (think Shrek 2's Prince Charming minus the Charming and the gay subtext), and the titular bunny, who's about to cause a lot of trouble. Almost 17 years on, Wallace and Gromit have lost absolutely none of their universal comic appeal, as people still laugh at their alternate moments in the spotlight. The script comprises impeccable gags, mostly visual (I was already grinning within the first 30 seconds of the movie), interesting, human characters and pop culture references which don't feel inappropriate or unnecessary at all (spoofs include King Kong, Harry Potter and even classics such as How Green Was My Valley, East of Eden and Brief Encounter). A great deal of the movie's magic is also linked to the animation technique: whereas Tim Burton's excellent Corpse Bride looked a little more CG than stop-motion, the W & G flick is pure claymation, and it's beautiful (there is some CGI, but you probably won't notice it). In a time where almost all animated films in the world, apart from the Studio Ghibli pictures, are made with pixels instead of pencils, the experience of watching a traditionally made cartoon is something that can't be easily matched by anything else. So, in a few words, Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is, with very little, if any, doubt, the best animated feature I've ever had the pleasure of viewing. It's constantly entertaining, never daft, and leaves you wanting more. Let's hope a sequel will show up in the near future...",1.0

296,"Simply A Work of Art; This movie first starts by boldly introducing two characters, in the 1950s a Jules (Samuel L Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) by jumping into their daily life. Starting off with no context towards their background, this film dumps you into a life of crime, murder, and drugs. As the plot progresses the film tells its story from the perspective of three different characters and completely engrosses you in its world. The intense need for violence in this movie is what drives us to the edge of our seats and keeps us there for the full length of the film. Quentin Tarantino used the aspect of different perspective to thoroughly encapsulate viewers and leave many in awe as they watch this film masterpiece.

48385,"I like.; Sacha Baron Cohen brings his best creationÂ—the Eastern European TV presenter BoratÂ—to the big screen in 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan', a movie which follows the (somehow) likable Jew-hater (accompanied by his friend Azamat Bagatov) as he makes his revealing documentary about life in the USA. Cohen cleverly (and rather bravely) uses his naive, racist and sexist Kazakhstani character to expose the bigots and idiots that often give the US a bad name, whilst simultaneously delivering some of the funniest cinematic moments in recent memory. Whether it is an average Joe on a subway train, a group of frat boys on a road-trip, or a room-full of people at a seminar, absolutely no-one is safe from Borat as he reveals a country brimming with hatred, distrust, and intolerance: it's a sad moment for the human race when Borat politely introduces himself to a stranger, only to be met with threats of violence. Of course, Borat's style of comedy is not going to be to everybody's taste: the more conservative of viewers may balk at the toilet humour and bad taste gags; rednecks and religious extremists will more than likely froth at the mouth at particular moments; and many Eastern Europeans probably won't like Cohen's portrayal of one of their own. The rest of us, however, should have a whale of a time. Some of Cohen's schtick might seem a little old hat to those familiar with Borat from UK TV, and, occasionally, the film has the tendency to feel somewhat staged (the Pamela Anderson segment is rumoured to have been set-up), but the movie's outrageous highlights more than make up for these minor quibbles. And if you're intending to watch this film on DVD, make sure to catch the hilarious deleted scenesÂ—one word: cheese.",0.0
6537,"2003 - the year of GOOD ""Third"" Movies!; 2003 has been a strange movie year. Usually, you don't see a good third movie. Of course there are exceptions..ie RETURN OF THE JEDI, AUSTIN POWERS 3 and one of my favorites SUPERMAN III. But then you get your bombs as well..GODFATHER III (I refuse to acknowledge this movie exists), JAWS 3D, HALLOWEEN 3, etc. In 2003, there were several very good third movies -- AMERICAN PIE 3, MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, TERMINATOR 3 and in December, LORD OF THE RINGS 3. When I first heard TERMINATOR 3 was being made, I was skeptical. No Jim Cameron, no Linda Hamilton, an unknown actor playing John Connor. TERMINATOR 3 was a pleasant surprise and I would rank it as one of the top films of 2003. Granted Arnie isn't the Arnie of 10-15 years ago, but he still proves to be a top-notch action star. Nick Stahl is superb taking over for Eddie Furlong as John Connor. There are some pretty decent action sequences in here (truck chase, cemetary shootout, etc) but the humor is severely lacking from T2. The ending is a shock.

527,"One of a kind; Schindler's List tells the tale of a German industrialist Oskar Schindler (28 April 1908 Â– 9 October 1974) who was credited to have saved over 1,100 Jews during the Holocaust. The movie is based on the book Schindler's Ark by Thomas Keneally. Steven Spielberg both directed and produced this movie, and has been received widely as a classic. The thing that catches your eye when watching this movie is the cruelty of war itself, there are just mainly losers no winners, only those who happen to be in-between that suffers, the men behind it sit behind a desk. Spielberg depicted such cruelty in the Camps. A scene where a Jew who made hinges was moved from where he is working to go shove coal and then when he was done he returned, Amon GÃ¶th (Ralph Fiennes) queried him for not meeting up to his regular toll of hinges and immediately had him arraigned to be executed, for something that was not his fault. That scene touched me. The movie was shot in KrakÃ³w, Poland for seventy-one days. Shots were done in real life locations, though the PÅ‚aszÃ³w camp had to be reconstructed in a pit adjacent to the original site, due to post-war changes to the original camp. The plot of the movie is direct; a German businessman named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) in Poland sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using bribes to win military contracts, and bringing in an accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory. He then hires Jews for the cheap pay, but later after witnessing the cruelty they face in the Nazi Camps, he then tried to get as much Jews away from the Camps to his factory, using all his savings to take care of them. The movie is not so bad when it comes to acting, but the main hat dipping should go to the Screenplay and the directing. The Screenplay and the script had to be perfect in other for us to be able to get the feel of what the Jews were going through. Also the directing had to be top notch so as not to get carried away by the suffering or the cruelty but to understand why a German will like to save the Jews. Although we know that much has been done by Liam Neeson (Taken), Ralph Fiennes (Harry Potter) and Ben Kingsley (Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time) over the years, but they will be fondly remembered for their role in this classic.

But many people in this film become collateral damage. There are multiple stories of people who got filmed thought it was a real documentary. And they were edited to make them look ridiculous. Those parts are not always that funny. They're usually too obvious. Anyways self deprecating humor is usually the best. Sacha really excels at making fun of Borat.

However, that was the only deepness within this gut-busting comedy. Not for years have I seen a comedy film that has had me laughing as hard as I was watching this. You could consider these jokes as being likewise to the Jackass or any other gross-out comedy, but this has intelligence & a style all of its own. Cohen touched the screen with a marvelous comedy that I don't think he can ever do again because of infamous popularity & cult status. Granted he was sued many times over, had the cops called on him nearly 100 times during production & caused an enormous amount of controversy in the press, he succeeded in making a cinematic classic & deserves his film to watched for years to come.

6537,An Amazing Action Packed Sequel.; I know that many people hate T3 i'm just not one of those people Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines Rocks. And Arnold is Back the new villain is really cool and she is a Woman. If there is something that i didn't like about this sequel is the way the director worked the humor it just didn't work at times but in others did. Also Connor's and Brewster's characters are weak but as the film goes on they find the strength they need to stop Judgment Day. Also the film has a great cameo by Dr. Silberman and an amazing ending that we didn't expect to see. T3: Rise of the Machines is an amazing action packed film and it deserves more respect for what it tried to acomplish and it was great to see Arnold returning on the role for one last time before Genisys. Even if it has those 3 problems i think Terminator 3 is still a great movie and it deserves a 10/10 for me.,0.0
48385,"Still Tasteless and Offensive!; Sasha Baron Cohen's Borat is quite a unique character. The comedian/actor portrays Borat, a Kazakhstan television personality. He goes to America to film a documentary. He starts off in New York City to Washington D.C. to Los Angeles, California in pursuit of Pamela Anderson. The film has some funny moments but they are overshadowed by the anti-Semitism in the film. Apparently in his village, there is a running of the Jew annual event which is not funny but offensive. When he and his partner Azamat stay with a nice older Jewish couple in America, they are so afraid that they leave in the middle of the night. The Anti-Semitism is bad enough for me but it's tasteless and offensive to actual Kazakhs who aren't' Anti-Semitic. Then there is the scenes in which naked Borat and Azamat are fighting naked and chasing each other throughout the hotel in Texas. It's gross and disgusting rather than funny. They are so afraid of Jews that they drive across country in an ice cream truck and they can't get a gun to protect themselves from the Jews so they get a live black bear. It's not funny but just offensive to Jews and to Kazakhs. If Sasha Baron Cohen wasn't Jewish himself, they wouldn't have gotten away with it in the first place.",0.0

That's his vocation. What's really offensive, yet hilarious, is the way the people in the US are exposed as the racist, homophobic rubes they really are. And when I saw Borat and his traveling companion Azamat get into their hotel room wrestling match, I almost laughed myself sick. I'd never seen a display like that before, and I hope I don't again, but at the time I saw it, I thought my heart would stop. When this encounter spilled over into a real estate brokers convention, well, that was all she wrote. Don't bother with this if you're an uptight airhead. You won't enjoy it.

6537,"He'll be back......; Well, I liked this movie. Granted it was very similar to number 2, even had similar scenes in it, but at least it was harmless fun. And, of course, it had big Arn in it. The supporting stars were OK too, not brilliant, but not dire. If you liked the second of the series, then this one will not disappoint you (unless you were angling for something different). Some of it is a little trite and, needless to say, it is almost entirely predictable, right down to the final scenes. But its Arnie, doing what Arnie does best.....breaking things. There are some nice views of the prototype hunter-killers that characterised the flashbacks in the second movie. But I swear one of the T1's shrugged after looking down a corridor for the intruders (Arnie and Co). Might have been my imagination, though. Anyway, good fun, but nothing new. Now all we have to do is wait for the fourth installment - yep, it ain't over with this one!",0.0
3751,"Have you PETA chicken today?; Though entertaining and well-crafted, I was disturbed by this movie's reckless subliminal message to kids:  chicken farming is evil, eating eggs is evil, and eating chickens is evil (plus, more obviously, chickens should be set free).  PETA's zealous fingerprints are all over this movie!  (PETA being People for the Ethical treatment of Animals.)  Like most zealots, whose basic premise may be sound -- yes, animals of course should be treated with respect -- over the course of time the zeal for the cause often overwhelms reason and common sense. If everyone indeed stopped farming chickens and eating them and their eggs, the species would quickly perish.  Why?  They have no other place in nature.  Since before recorded history, chickens have always been bred and raised for their eggs and meat.  Anyone ever seen a wild chicken fending for itself out there?  Release them all tomorrow into the woods and forests and fields and just see how long they last. Which the filmmakers seem to recognize at the end, by showing the escaped chickens living happily ever after, not amongst the other creatures of the wild, but in the protection of a former bird sanctuary.

4886,"Absolutely average; The story: In Monsterworld, energy is produced by collecting kids' screams, which are then converted into electricity. ""Monsters, Inc."" is the leading energy producer, and it operates by sending monsters into kids' closets and under their beds, and scaring them. Each kid has its own biggest fear, and the company specializes in delivering just the right monster to the right kid. There are, however, two problems. First, kids are getting harder to scare, watching all those movies and playing all those videogames - which causes an energy crisis. And second, human kids are considered to be toxic to monsters - the most memorable scene occurs when a monster returns from his job with a sock stuck to his fur.... So it is easy to imagine what mayhem may ensue if a kid manages to get into Monstropolis... The story follows two nice monsters, Sullivan, the most successful scarer, and his side-kick Mike, as they try to get rid off, hide, play with and protect (in that order) a little girl that finds her way into their world. It also features an evil chamaeleon monster and a cast of many very inspired background monsters, including a love interest for Mike. Watch out for her hair: It is one of the better ideas in the movie. However, as nice as it sounds, this movie is strictly for kids only. Adults might chuckle every now and then, but in the end I walked out thinking of all the wasted talent. Why cast comedians like Billy Crystal and John Goodman as voice talents when the best comedy is restricted to a very small number of slapstick scenes? Also, the movie is very very obvious about its story and the surprise (or not so surprise) ending. It is made with kids in mind, so every lesson is repeated about five times. And, of course, it is about friendship, the power of being nice and all the other typical Disneyfied lessons in life. You might also notice this Pixar trend of only producing movies that are very very merchandiseable. Toy Story? Think plastic toys. Monster Inc? Think big Sulley-shaped fluffy animals... There is one point where this movie is hard to beat, though: The animation. The fur of Sulley is incredible, and when he is hit by a snowball, it is most impressive how real it looks. All in all it is very average. Not very funny, a bit repetitive, but entirely feel-good. Personally, I preferred the short movie that preceded it. It was short, funny, cute, to the point and it had all the qualities Monsters Inc lacked. Make sure you aren't late for this movie. You might miss the best part.... Also stay for the credits. Some of the fake outtakes are funny, especially the guest appearances of other Pixar characters... 5/10",0.025
4886,"Mindless trash for the no attention span masses.; Did anyone actually watch this?

Don't worry, it's going to happen again soon, so be patient during those three seconds of the characters talking, your mindless garbage is going to repeat itself real soon.

8874,"Absolutely brilliant!; Now THIS was a nice surprise! Finally a decent film, and this is definitely one of the funniest I've seen in a long, long time! Granted, to like this movie it DOES require that you like films such as Braindead and Bad Taste both by Peter Jackson - who by the way warmly recommends it as well - but the humour alone is worth it. Nice acting as well, sure sometimes it may seem overacted but it fits the style of film perfectly, and the very vivid expressions of the actors only makes it all the more funny.. *SPOILERS* The title is totally fitting, the leading character Shaun IS living a zombie like existence - not in the accurate sense of the word but you know what I mean - and the fact alone that he is walking amongst zombies and hours without noticing something is wrong is just hilarious.

2571,"Awful mixture; Something sad happened with this film. The Hollywood Academy give it some Oscar (special effects, I think). So young people newcomer to cinema world thought it must be a good picture. They did not know that not all the winning Oscar movies deserve it. It is a deceitful, spurious and incredibly pretentious film. Because one thing is Cinema and another thing are computers. If you want to said something in cinema' way you must use cinematography ways. Cinematography language has got his own implements. It is a very old discovery (more than 100 years old) and it was marching on and growing up with hard work, effort, wisdom and -many times- talent. Never with computers. The film responsible commit in my opinion a unforgivable lack os respect. It seen they does not know authors like Griffith, Chaplin, Stroheim, Sternberg, Welles, Dreyer, Ford, Hawks, Walsh, Curtiz, Lang, Reed, Renoir, BuÃ±uel, Kurosawa, Wilder...

But the  overall message is so powerful and moving.  From beginning to end, it held my attention.  And one of the best things is: not only do you feel like you're watching a movie.

4326,"""What is wrong with these people""; I never understood why this movie was never on the Top 250. If American History X can make the Top 250 why not Mississippi Burning? Even Crash made the top 250 and this movie is way more powerful than Crash will ever be. Incredible. Mississippi Burning is a very hard film to look at but a very truthful and gritty look at racism in southern Mississippi during the Civil Rights era. The story details FBI agents Rupert Anderson(Gene Hackman)and Alan Ward(Willem Dafoe) search for the killers an African-American male and two Jewish males. Their search takes them to the heart of Mississippi where the racism is deep-seated and the police are inflexible to a fault. They later realize how deep the police involvement in the killings were. No other movie about race relations has moved me like Mississippi Burning has. American History X is phenomenal but it didn't make me as angry as this movie did. I wish I had the power to stop these psychos from doing what they did. Mississippi Burning was the movie that made me question my faith in organized religion. I couldn't fathom that I was believing in the same belief system that these racist lunatics were believing in. I dumped belief in organized religions after extensive research at the age of 20 but this movie sparked my curiosity. Gene Hackman is wonderful as Agent Rupert. He steals every scene he is in. Willem Dafoe is great as his partner Alan Ward. Agent Anderson(Hackman) handles things in an unconventional manner while Agent Ward(Dafoe) is by the book. This is where Dafoe showed his true potential before he started screwing up his career by appearing in raw sewage like Speed 2, Boondock Saints, Body Of Evidence and XXX: State Of The Union. Also great in this movie is Brad Dourif as the racist Deputy Clinton Pell and R. Lee Ermey as the racist mayor. I also like how they showed the views of the average ignorant Mississippian and how the cops either participated in the killing and terrorizing of Blacks in Mississippi or sat back and watched it happen. Conclusion: Mississippi Burning is the best movie of 1989 hands down and is definitely required viewing. But be forewarned that this is not an easy movie to watch. But if you can stomach the racial violence and slurs you have a gem on your hands. I find it sad that the director Alan Parker didn't have many movies after this one.",0.0

Two FBI came to the village, where this happened and investigated the case It was just an example of what was going on there. The best of the film is the acting of the whole group of actors and actresses led by Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, the latter as a generous FBI detective instead of being a villain as usual. The film left no doubt that KKK is (or was) a terrorist organization with a complete lack of human feelings, only with the obsession to kill black people, to reduce its population and denigrate it any way.

5816,"""The Force"" was certainly with Columbus this time around!; An incredible turnaround from the first outing. Being unshakeably of the opinion that despite so many other shortcomings, Daniel Radcliffe single handedly sank the first movie with his total lack of charisma, acting ability and screen presence, I'm here to tell you that somehow - whether through an intense acting course or by virtue of perhaps, Columbus' positive influence - Radcliffe has come up with a total make-over. He IS Harry Potter now! As well as moving up to warp factor 5 on the acting scale...he is moving and presenting well...dammit, the lad was just plain excellent here! Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley however, who was so memorable in the Sorcerer's Stone, totally burying Radcliffe's performance, is cruelly over-shadowed here and several times borders on the irritable! Emma Watson reprises her role as Hermione and mega-cute and intellectually appealing . The introduction of Dobby the house elf simply guaranteed the film's success alone - one of the most endearing and professional looking CGI characters I have yet had the pleasure to see. True, the flying Ford Anglia wasn't so hot....at best, a BOYS OWN tribute with limited realism and that is being overly kind. The other ramped-up stroke of utter genius was Kenneth Branagh's turn as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart. At times highly reminiscent of a young Christopher Plummer, he simply walked off with the movie. Every scene he was in was a gem. Can't say that Branagh has ever generated much in the way of appeal for me - too intense and low on interest - charismatically undercooked you might say! This however, is his moment of greatness. Forget Shakespeare Ken this is the real you! ""Tragic,"" is the only word to describe Richard Harris' death so soon after the film's completion. Dumbledore will be hard to replace. Rumor has it that Christopher Lee has been offered the part - one that he could fill in his sleep. He has the age, height, vocal command and physical presence to fill the role - even without fangs! Meanwhile I would simply like to make the comment that Richard Harris contributed greatly to the success of both HARRY POTTER films thus far, by virtue of his remarkable gentility, strength and utterly projected compassion. Columbus and crew really pulled their combined weight with the latest Quidditch match. That in the original movie was borderline reality and not even especially interesting or adrenaline-fuelled. The game here is thumping good stuff and superbly choreographed and realised. Columbus keeps THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS moving at a deft pace. The art work and production detail really quite staggering. I would venture to suggest however that the concluding scenes in the Chamber itself, would be quite scary and potentially disturbing to some really young viewers. Parents should be aware of this! HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is everything a film should be. Decent, exciting, principled, colorful, always interesting and at all times entertaining. It blows the first LORD OF THE RINGS out of the water...the first HARRY POTTER too!",0.0

The first half is straight comedy and great comedy at that with the second half being more horror with some comedy thrown in. Shaun is a guy who works a average job but doesn't have much on the ball and no ambition to speak of (please stop reading if this hits too close to home which it probably does for most of us guys) not to mention the fact that he is dating a pretty girl who is getting way more than just tired of his backsliding and his complete lack of sensitivity and romantic tendencies. All he wants to do is drink at his favorite pub the Winchester and keep his relationship with her on life support which causes her to break up with him. His roommate is a complete a-hole and his best friend is a loser who doesn't have a job, plays video games nonstop and sells weed. He hates his father-in-law and he is sleepwalking through life. Then things start moving when zombies suddenly start appearing and Shaun has to deal with them. He does the best he can but not being up to snuff on zombie killing he has to try a little harder to save his family, friends and even his girlfriend from joining the legions of undead.

71057,"Good, but not Great...; The biggest downfall of 9 is its total lack of character development. If the movie had just another 10-15 minutes for you to get to know the rag-doll characters, it would be much more enjoyable. As it stands, 9 is an entertaining post-apocalyptic action adventure story with an interesting twist on the man vs. machine theme. It just seems such a shame that a movie with this kind of potential falls flat because of something so major. Character development is key in a story like this. Especially when you're dealing with such a small group of characters to begin with. But, you really know nothing of the characters beyond what 9 himself knows. That's regrettable, especially with a powerhouse cast voicing every major player (at least those that really speak)... Character development aside, the movie is visually impressive, and does what any movie of this sort should do: expands and improves upon the short film from which it was sculpted. This year's other ""9er"" (District 9) did the same thing. The overall story is good, the writing is decent, and the action is undeniably some of the coolest ever in a CG animated film...

6537,"A great addition to the Terminator series.; The movie was amazing. I'm not exactly sure how somebody can 'fool themselves' into liking a movie just by being a die hard fan, but that's not the case with me. I was a huge Ninja Turtles fan, but still think the third movie was horrible. As much as I liked the first two Back to the Future films, I believe that the third in the trilogy isn't good at all. Alien 3? Don't get me started. The Terminator trilogy, on the other hand, happens to be the best in my opinion. Each movie in the series is by far excellent. The first one is great because of the intriguing storyline and dark feeling; the second being awesome because of the several scenes of hilarity and sweet special effects; the third belongs with the first two because of the mind-blowing action that slams you in your seat. The ongoing storyline that continues throughout all three movies is awesome. The action scenes, I guess, are where I'll begin. The chase/fight scenes were absolutely remarkable. If anybody tells you that the effects looked cheesy, shoot them in the face if a gun is available; if not, bludgeon them with the nearest blunt object. The special effects were by far better than they were in T2, so every action scene that occurred (which was very often) was stupendous. For true Terminator fans, consider T3 a treat for including several references to the past two movies. I'm a gigantic fan of the Terminator series so I was able to pick up on several small references, which was really cool. Some cameos from previous characters were nifty (including Dr. Silberman). The storyline isn't really a rehash of the first two movies; it went on a different pretense. The TX's mission parameters weren't only to assassinate some of the Resistance leaders, but to also see to it that Judgement Day begins. I don't understand many people's big gripe with the ending. I would discuss it, but I won't give out spoilers to people who haven't seen it yet. But I'll say that the ending was invariably appropriate, in my opinion. I guess you'll either like it or hate it. It's not that I feel it's a brilliant ending, but I do think that it was the best way to end this particular film. If you really like the first Terminator movie, you'll most likely appreciate Terminator 3. If you didn't like the first one, then it's hard to say. Either way, expect to see some of the greatest action sequences you've ever seen.",0.0
903,"everything one would expect from Hitchcock; The only reason I do not give this movie a 10 is kind of the same reason why I did not give the graduate a 10. It is because the love story felt totally uninspired. Maybe they also kissed differently back then, but when Scotty kisses Judy when she dresses up like Madaline again it does not seem very passionate. Other than that the movie was amazing. I don't think I have seen the lighting trick in any other movie used as effectively as in this movie. When Scotty is learning about the history of Carlotta and the scene just gets dark is a great scene. Somehow the story seems like a standard affair in terms of plots for modern movies, but Hitchcock manages to make it an edge of your seat thriller. Jimmy Stewart did an amazing job as allows and the end it seems as if he just may have it in him to kill Judy. He manages to shed his nice guy persona and is downright scary. There is nothing better than watching a classic film and seeing where the greats get their motivation for making great movies. I have to say that I did love the dream sequence and the look in his face is possibly one of the best reaction shots to a dream. I do not know why movies are just not better written now a days. There was some quick dialog that you do not get in movies like this. It is hard to imagine not falling in love the type of characters that Jimmy Stewart portrays because they just don't make actors like him anymore. If you gave him the lines all you needed to do was put a camera on him. I also liked how they did not show what happened after Judy killed herself because I would like to think of him falling back into despair, but the fact that it is left up to the viewer shows a level of respect to the viewer that one does not see anymore. Jimmy Stewarts up and downs in the movie could not have been done better and seeing him in his most pathetic is really a testament of how good of an actor he is.

4886,"Cute.; *May contain spoilers* *May contain spoilers* The idea of the film is nothing short of brilliant. The monsters of our childhood do exist. Only they exist because they need to collect the screams of the children so Monsters' city will have enough  electricity supply. And technically it is flawless. Pixar has come long way from its first computer animated film. It succeed each time to go a step further and this is no exception. However the technical achievement get lost in a story which is as thin as ice and also suffer from the fact that Disney had to put its usual inserted messages(this time: friends are forever and laugher is stronger than scream). Dream Works' Shrek has proven that an animated film can be wild and sarcastic. Monsters Inc. stays however on the safe side and as always with Disney very politically correct. And that is a shame because what could have been a wild film turn out to be only a cute one. Yes I enjoyed it and laughed from it but I wish it was less politically correct(The ending leave no question in your mind that we are heading for a sequel). Pixar should think of breaking away from Disney. It will only do them good and give them the opportunity to do what they really want. P.S. Do not miss what is shown before Monsters Inc. A short film named ""For the Birds"". Simply hilarious. It proves that with the right thing Pixar can do even better.",0.025
5816,"A slight decrease in quality; This film is the second entry in the hyper-successful Harry Potter franchise. In terms of box office, it became number 4 of the year 12 years ago. Like the first, it was directed by Chris Columbus (""Mrs. Doubtfire"", ""The Goonies"", ""Home Alone""), who did not return for film number 3, and written by Steve Kloves based on a Rowling novel. Kloves kept writing for all the films that followed afterward. Just like for Columbus, this was also the last performance for Richard Harris. The actor who portrayed Albus Dumbledore died not much later. ""The Chamber of Secrets"" included some creative inclusions of new characters and story lines, but it also fell flat on developing on some of the parts from the first film. Very early on we are introduced to Gobby, an interesting character and the Potter equivalent to Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"". You could almost say that this film has a message against racism with the victims here being Mudbloods. Fittingly, Malfoy's dad who is also new in the movie has an equally Arian look as his son. The Slytherin house is the one who is against letting Mudbloods (children with magic abilities from non-magic parents) into Hogwarts. At the one scene with the new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher (Kenneth Branagh, one of the more forgettable) and Snape I was wondering why they would support the Potter-Malfoy rivalry by letting them fight against each other. I don't expect good teachers to do that. This film is maybe the one that tells us most about the Malfoy dynasty, also about Hagrid and about the history of the different houses, well actually mostly about Slytherin. Too bad the other houses except that and Grffindor are rarely mentioned. I bet they have some nice stories too. I was not too big on Moaning Myrtle, who did not add something really interesting to the story for me and same goes for the way they travel by a flying car instead of the train this time. Good job on the car though from rescuing the boys from the spider invasion. Man these spiders were creepy (another ""Lord of the Rings"" parallel). And Ron's face expressions there were simply priceless. We get to know a bit more about the Weasleys and especially Ginny plays a bigger role here and gets slowly introduced as a love interest to Harry's character with how she was talking about him all the time during the holidays and how Harry is the one who has to save her in the end in a 1 vs 1 battle again just like in the first film. Okay, this one also has a giant snake, which makes things tougher for little Harry. Then there was this part where the boys transformed into two boys from Slytherin, which was basically a good idea, but the way they constantly kept almost revealing themselves by accident made it a bit ridiculous sadly. For most of the part, Potter is hearing strange voices and wonders if Griffindor was really the right choice for him, a bit of an identity crisis? A lot of it is also about his ability to speak with snakes as this was an ability the creator of Slytherin possessed as well. The film is very long, runs for 160 minutes and I believe they certainly could have cut 15 or more minutes and it would not have hurt the film, maybe even helped it. For example the Quidditch game did not add anything for me apart from another random way of Malfoy and Potter going against each other with the usual outcome. I personally felt the film came a bit short compared to the first and also the third (the two best films in my opinion), but it is nonetheless worth a watch and be it only to see the development of characters. Many people may have felt the same as this is one of 2 Potter films that did not score any Academy award nominations. It got a couple noms for its visual/technical work at the BAFTAs though. However, it has still it's funny moments, like Hermione's face expression when she hears the exams are canceled and everybody else is cheering or also the letter to Ron from his family. Lots of cute little details included here again. Only the main plot was not so good this time. Recommended.",0.0
903,"The Master Does It Again; Alfred Hitchcock made a lot of excellent films. This James Stewart - Kim Novack film is a gem. The cast is extremely well suited for the film. Vera Miles was the original choice of Alfred to play Novaks role but production delays because of Hitch's Gall Bladder surgery & then Miles could not do the film because she was pregnant. The script is based upon a French novel, the original working title of the film is ""From the Dead"". Stewart is a policeman who gets a fear of heights on the job, & then his fears are played by a evil one who cons him into believing someone he loves is dead. He nearly goes off a commits suicide when he finds out he has been used for a dishonest purpose when he finds the girl he fell in love with, only to lose her again. Barbara Bel Geddes (Miss Ellie on Dallas) is dandy in support as Stewarts lady in waiting. Novak, Stewart, & Bel Geddes are intense in their roles. Ellen Corby (Grandma Walton) & Raymond Bailey (Milburn Drysdale on the Beverly Hillbillies) also do support roles. This film has great special effects The restored version looks great with over $1 million dollars invested in it by Universals restoration team. San Francisco & the Bay Bridge look very well in the shots there. Hitchcock actually chose the locations for this film while he was shooting Strangers on Train in 1951. San Francisco never looks better on film then in this one. Bernard Herman does a great score.

The cast are wonderful in the movie. What a good actor Ralph Fiennes is. They say if an actor playing a bad guy, can truly make his audience hate him, he has a gift for acting. Well, I truly hated Fiennes at the end of this movie. Not the man himself, of course, but the evil German Nazi he was playing, Amon Goertz. Having seen a documentary on Schindler a few weeks after the movie came out, Fiennes also chillingly looks like the real Goertz. **** SPOILERS AHEAD... DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVENT SEEN THE FILM The film was shot in Black and White, to add an eerily atmosphere, which made it look more realistic. But the bit I broke down to at the cinema, was the young girl that you spot in the Red Coat, running away with the rest of the people. Then a few scenes later, as the Germans are pouring the bodies of Jews into the mass Burial hole, you see the girl in the red coat come out of the wheelbarrow and into the pit. This was too much for my Girlfriend, who left the cinema. Also the ending where Schindler is apologizing to Stern for not saving more Jews was quite moving. I remained in my seat, alone, and just watched as the real survivors of the holocaust, and the actors that played them were led to Schindler's Grave to lay a stone. And then the final bit where you dont actually see him, but Neeson lays a flower on the grave of the hero he had just portrayed - and so convincingly. In years to come when Speilberg is long gone, I believe he`ll best be remembered for several films: Jaws, Back to the Future, Saving Private Ryan, Jurassic Park and this one. 10/10.  ",0.0
4388,I want my money back....; This movie totally sucked ass. I bought it on dvd b/c I had the first one and I thought hey this movie looks funny boy was I wrong this movie was awful. The only good clip in the movie was a clip that they cut out. It is when David Cross was driving his car and when people tried to help him he yelled at them I laughed through the whole thing. Chris Elliot tried to be as funny as Deputy Doofey but he just couldnt do it. This movie was a waste of film and they should of had a sticker on the movie saying:WARNING THIS MOVIE SUCKS. So do your self a favor and avoid this film.,0.0
1246,"Beautiful and interesting; 'Dead Poets Society' is a beautiful movie from start to finish. The movie tells the story of a new English teacher, Mr. Keating (Robin Williams), who is a lot different than other teachers. He wants the students to think for themselves although other teachers disagree with this vision. They think a boy that is 17 years old is not able to think for himself. You can imagine how the story develops; the students like Mr. Keating, the other teachers don't. Mr. Keating teaches poetry to the students, and inspires some of them to do things they never thought they would do. Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) discovers that his real passion is acting, and Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) learns he can do a lot more than he thought he could. There is also a story line involving a student named Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles) who is in love with a girl and because of Mr. Keating he tries to win her over. Of course things can't go right and some tragic events happen. I will not reveal them here. May be they are not very surprising but they do have an impact. Robin Williams as the smart and funny teacher has one of his finest roles here. He is known as a funny guy, but as in 'Good Will Hunting' he finds the perfect way for this part. The students are all very good as well, especially Robert Sean Leonard and Gale Hansen, who plays a guy named Charlie Dalton. The fine direction by Peter Weir completes this very beautiful and interesting movie.",0.0
2302,"Very entertaining film; My Cousin Vinny is a very fun, well acted, entertaining film. The cast includes Marisa Tomei, Joe Pesci, Ralph macchio, and Fred Gwyne. The main thing about this film that works is the comedy and the performances by the cast that lifts up and enhances the comedic writing. Marisa Tomei is by far the best in the cast with her performance and her delivery of her lines. She deserved that academy award win. Her character is a tough, very New York woman who knows just about everything there is to know about cars. And that proves to be crucial in the court case. Joe Pesci is also very good in his role, Vincent gambini. He and Marisa have great chemistry together, whether it's in a romantic way or they're butting heads. Fred Gwyne is great as the judge, I mean could you have picked out a better more suitable fit for the overly strict judge? Who else besides Mr. Munster? The movie has well thought out pacing too, not too slow but also not too fast. It's not one sided either, it shows the point of view from Pesci and Tomei's, the judges, and Macchio and his friends. I liked that, each character got an ample amount of screen time. The ending is very clever and satisfying. Just when you think all hope is lost, Pesci comes up with a brilliant idea. 9/10.",0.0

The chickens are so cute and imaginatively formed that you want to play with them.

The analogy of the chicken farm as concentration camp may seem a little much, but it works here.  And the inspiring ending doesn't lay an egg.",0.875

I also liked the cameo from the doctor from the first 2 films. I like this movie for the nostalgia. I went into the theater not knowing what to expect, so i was pleasantly suprised. The new TX is hot and plays a good villian. This is a different film than the first 2 but remember that the first 2 films were also different from each other. I can't compare it to the first 2 because i was a kid when i saw them. I actually saw T2 at the theater when it first came out. Theres no way to compare the feeling i had when i saw that to this, it was a different feel. Without giving anything away i really liked the ending. t3 - 8/10",0.0

6537,"It's Good To Be Back; Mostow has injected a lot of the same spirit from previous Terminator films into Terminator 3, cleverly causing you to undergo a bit of what weightlifters call `muscle memory.' Although wildly entertaining and pleasantly reminiscent of past films, Terminator 3 as a whole did not resonate like the first two films. That's not to say it didn't achieve greatness, just not the type of greatness Cameron achieved in the good old days. The key change from Cameron to Mostow proved too dissonant for some fans. Cameronistas resent Mostow's style as action over substance. Reading their remarks on the movie forums would have one believe the film represents more of a lowering of humans than rising of machines. T3 is not T2. Mostow is not Cameron. Let James Cameron be James Cameron, or at least Jim Cameron, and let everyone else be themselves. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines had to hold its ground and simply not be bad. It held. It did more than that. It succeeded. Humor, action, and preservation of the Terminator motifs gave the film life. The word `terminated' will continue to live as a great movie euphemism. Whether or not the Terminator series will rise again, only time will tell. --Emory Rowland ",0.0
48385,"The most brazen and impertinent film to come in ages; and one of the funniest, too.; Jagshemash! Sacha Baron Cohen, star of HBO's hit comedy series, ""Da Ali G Show,"" further embraces the Kazakh TV journalist Borat Sagdiyev, extending his ludicrous mannerisms and farcical cultural habits to us by way of the most brazen and impertinent film to come in ages; and one of the funniest, too. ""Borat"" is a new breed of cinema; one in which insolent humor and audacious pranks are loaded upon unsuspecting persons with neither regret nor apology. This class of comedy is one unafraid of all those out there who will, with their every breath, attempt at discrediting its material. And it is of no fantasy that this film will be a target for many to pursue in the months following its release. The film's crude go-about-things is relentless in its hunt to abash and debase any and all social cliques, glorified unions and self-reputed organizations. However, beneath the barbaric slaughtering of all targeted by this film (which varies from Jews, Gypsies, gays and blacks to Feminists and cowboys and the American Fraternity) is concealed a furtively executed pearl of comedic cinema; one that will only grow in its likability, despite being anything but. As would say Borat, ""Great success!""",0.0
2571,"Something For The Nerds; 'The Matrix' contains some of the most spectacular special effects and action sequences of any movie. Judged by those alone, it would definitely qualify 10 stars. There's an excellent cast who make a sterling effort on sets that must - for the most part be virtual. All of the other standards of sound, lighting, directing are right on the money. As to the script - well it's little more than an endless stream of flatulent gobbledegook. Applaud or yawn, as you will. And as to the science fiction element; well that's plain bonkers. Machines breeding humans to exploit their brain energy? Those machines must be daft as brushes. There are far more efficient ways to create power. We should know; we breed the other domesticated species for just that purpose. Marvel at the technical elements but don't be taken in by them. This is a very simple movie when the Gothic grandeur, computer junk, and action sequences are set aside. I suspect that the strength of its appeal derives from the fact that it is basically the time-honoured 'rite of passage story' which is probably older than our own species. Basically; a young man must advance and prove himself as leader, gain the respect of a loyal band, then confront and defeat a powerful enemy. 'Star Wars', Lord of the Rings', 'Harry Potter', 'Saving Private Ryan'; they're all retreads of this ancient tribal format that is very likely instinctive in all human males.",0.0
38038,"Cracking good entertainment for the whole family!; The film starts with a very funny short featuring the Madagascar penguins. Curse of the Were Rabbit isn't as good as the three classic shorts, and the recent Matter of Loaf and Death, but the visual jokes and the memorable characters delight. I particularly loved the one about stinking cheese, and when Victor Quartermine puts the rabbit on his head by mistake. The plot is inspired, about a were rabbit who eats all the vegetables, and Wallace and Gromit try to stop him. The voice talents are superb, with Peter Sallis a standout with his vocal characterisation of Wallace, as does Ralph Fiennes as Victor. Helena Bonham Carter also does well, but the highlight was Gromit, with his facial expressions. The script sparkled with wit, imagination and inspiration, and the ending had some poignancy. Technically, the film is faultless with superb claymation. Overall, I award Curse of the Were Rabbit 8/10. Bethany Cox",1.0

You will be in stitches at the outrageous characters and impossible situations, from the first shot on. This baby pokes a finger in every star-studded eye you care to mention.

2571,"Good movie, but not without it's flaws.; The Matrix was pretty groundbreaking wasn't it? It showed the world that big budget action movies can be philosophical. That said, looking at it now, it does have a dated appearance. Does that make it any less a film. Not exactly, but it's easier to laugh at some of the things about it. We've all seen people make fun of Keanu Reeves going, ""Whoah."" That said I still like the movie. It's a fun action flick that also makes you think, and I like that. The story was good, the effects are good, most of the acting is good (most of it), and I really do appreciate what this film did for the action genre. It wasn't unheard of for action movies to be philosophical, it just wasn't as common as it now. Today a lot of action movies can double as thinker movies, and a lot of that is down The Matrix.

2571,"131 Minutes of Brilliance, 5 Minutes of Incompetence; Films like The Matrix do not come often. It boasts a complex storyline and fascinating concept. It creates an alternate reality so tangible, one could truly believe in its existence. The Matrix is a film as ambitious as they come. And while it's is not without flaw (and indeed, there are many), The Matrix is so refreshingly original and delightfully entertaining, that many problems can be overlooked. What cannot be overlooked, however, is the final 5 minutes, which is among the worst endings in memory. Spoiling as little as possible (though it's rare to find someone these days that haven't yet see this film), The Matrix creates the idea that the world we live in, is not real. It is, in fact, something called, The Matrix. The audience explores the true world with the protagonist, Thomas A. Anderson, as he struggles to comprehend the extent of this revolutionary discovery. The concept is terribly fascinating. It's hard to explain anything at all without spoiling things, but it is ingenious. Many have argued that it's not entirely original, and I agree, there are definitely elements lifted from other Sci-Fi films, but they're arranged in such a way (and given enough subtle changes) to make a satisfying and intriguing concept. The story is complex, and confusion is almost necessary. The film possesses an almost dream-like quality, in which little makes sense (likely intentionally). Scenes cut to and fro with little transition or fanfare, adding to the dream-like aesthetic of the film. One would be forgiven for criticizing the film for suggesting far too many questions (and supporting them with far too few answers). And while it is a tad irksome, many of these questions are probably better left to the imagination. Other notable flaws include some expository lines (that do a poor job of concealing themselves), and some weak writing at times. But the biggest problem with this film (and the only really significant detriment) is the ending; specifically the last 5 minutes. To explain everything that's problematic with the ending would take a far greater deal of time than anyone has to write nor read about. Never mind the fact that this is a spoiler-free review! To put it as simply and spoiler-free as possible, the ending is inconclusive. Not in the way that inspires sequels (though this film has spawned two add-ons to date), but rather, it doesn't resolve anything. The dilemma created at the beginning of the film is not dealt with, and the film doesn't acknowledge this. Even had it been left as a cliffhanger for a sequel, I might have forgiven it. But instead, it looks at the sky and whistles innocently, completely ignoring the fact that it's fascinating concept has been left alone. In fact, after the concept is established, The Matrix reverts to a high-level heist film - that is still engrossing, and smashingly put together, but it's lacking the brilliance that it initially promises. On top of that, the ending gives way to a lot of conveniences and cop- outs, and is both very un-cinematic, and highly anti-climatic. There are a good number of action sequences, and they are exceptionally crafted, though there are certainly too many of them. The Kung-Fu is cool, and even some of the shoot 'em ups are neat, but they become exhausting after a while. And one can only watch nameless henchmen miss the protagonists so much before becoming skeptical. Also, the gratuitous amount of slo-mo just comes across as dated, and the excessive amount of destruction in the last hour just makes the film seem like it's trying too hard; especially when there's a very interesting concept that feels like it's been ignored in favor of said action and destruction. Still, there's an excellent chase sequence at the very end that's among the best in recent memory. Keanu Reeves is engaging in the lead, and Laurence Fishburne is solid alongside Reeves (though he talks in an odd, robotic way - perhaps intentionally). Hugo Weaving also has an odd speech pattern in the role of the antagonist, though he pulls it off much better. He's as menacing as Sci-Fi villains get. The supporting cast is good, but not great (Matt Doran as Mouse fares the best). Don Davis' score does what a good score does; and that is improve the film. Many scenes are significantly improved through Davis' music, as it provides tension and texture. Though it occasionally gives way to too much drums and not enough melody, it's an admirable effort that gets the job done. The Matrix is the kind of film one can talk about for days. It has a lot of depth and substance, and the plot is hugely complex and open for interpretation. And yet, the pros and cons also merit discussion. The Matrix scores a lot of points by simply being entertaining, smart, and original. But the ending is so hugely unsatisfying that the 2 hours preceding the final five minutes is nearly undone as a result of its incompetence. The Matrix is a weird, wild ride. It's just a shame that the payoff (if it can be called that) is so abysmally weak.",0.0

296,"Stylistic Brilliance; If I may, let me note what a year 1994 was for film. This film. Shawshank. Gump. The Lion King. If someone came up to me and started ranting about how this was the best cinematic year ever, I'd actually listen to them for awhile before asking them why they are getting in my face. Of those films, this and Shawshank stand out, because they were not pre-established blockbusters. Gump and Lion King were expected to be pretty big, and just turned out bigger than anyone could possibly imagine. But these films were smaller, more personal projects. They are also quite different from each other in almost every other way; a notable one being that while Shawshank barely made back its budget at the box office, this film took off. Over the last couple weeks, with Steve Jobs and the like, we have examples of platforming failing. But it can succeed: this film is a prime example of that. This is important not just if you're incurably a nut about these sort of things, like am I. It means that this is the first exposure a lot of people had with a Tarantino film. I bet a lot of people became fans for life at some random matinÃ©e screenings some cloudy Tuesdays. This is one of those films that I would have loved to be there at one of its early screenings. A lot of minds were opened those days. I hope I'm not overselling this film, but it is one of those films that is so great that it is nearly impossible to oversell, which is a positive for me, as I love my gushing descriptions, as you might be able to tell if you read my review of Mad Max: Fury Road. One thing that must be noted about this film is that it goes out of order, and not a semi-organized out of order like Memento. This does not make the film hard to follow- it is easier to follow than Memento, at any rate- but it does make you think on your feet. Sometimes, I think that this whole movie is a then-young Mr. Tarantino taking a hunk of dynamite to the usual three-act structure. And it is glorious. No film better encapsulates the rush of exciting new filmmakers that we had in the 90s than this one. The title describes this film so well. It's not based on the style of blockbuster films. This isn't Jaws or Indiana Jones. This is darker, dirtier, less-universally subject matter. This is the equivalent of those books you keep for a trip to the doctor's office or the DMV just so you can be pulled out of the doldrums of life. It's not trying to be one of those Great American Novels written by Fitzgerald or Steinbeck that is typically only read by 'normal people' when they are in an English class or when they feel particularly scholarly. Of course, most of those novels were not particularly good, even at being what they are. This film is. It's clever, action-packed, well-written, and so much more. It represents a stark change from the happy-go-lucky (sometimes), subtle (often), and averse from breaking new ground (usually) attitudes of eighties movies and holds up a banner for nineties film. In the nineties, the same techniques that were developed for dark and gritty and serious movies like The Godfather or Apocalypse Now were being played apart the fabric of the mainstream. Yes, kids movies got even cheesier and less legit. But they no longer defined the market like they did in the prior decade. Artistic exploration became the norm. And few did that more than Mr. Tarantino, particularly in this film. Yes, if pulp fiction is what people expected, pulp fiction is what they got. But they did not get it in the way that they expected. To once more go back to MM:FR, I'm willing to be there were people who went into that film expecting to see just another action film in the style of the dime-a-dozen Die Hard and James Bond knock-offs that pop up so often every year. Their experience with that movie is probably on the level as anyone who came into this film expecting to see a mere piece of pulp fiction. This film is not a part of that 'genre', if you can call it that, but both an homage to it and its leading light. It transcends its grounds, its place in time, and perhaps even the medium of film itself. It is pure artistry. I cannot exaggerate how much of a breath of fresh air this was. Pretty much every problem with film in the eighties was given an antidote. It's also a good cure for everything from with major filmmaking today, though I argue that a more artsy version of the Hunger Games series would be a better one. But that's just me. As you might expect from a film that took off like this, it launched several careers and revived others, including that of John Travolta, who for once uses his overacting to his advantage. The soundtrack, of course, is phenomenal and iconic. Enough so that when I wrote the words Pulp Fiction down on the page, the first thing that popped into my mind was the title theme (Misirlou as covered by Dick Dale and the Daletones, in case you were wondering). Above all, when I watched this film, I felt a love for film and artistry, as well as a desire to build upon the works of the past while making a unique mark. It enraptures you in itself. Honestly, I'm kinda surprised that it took off like it did back then. But I'm not surprised that it's remembered today. It holds a unique place in society and is one of the definitive 90s films.

4326,"Symbolic Burning Crosses and Simplistic Storytelling; Three civil rights activists (2 blacks, 1 white) go missing & presumed murdered by white racists (the Klu Klux Klan) in some small town in the heart of Mississippi during the race protests of 1964 . Enter two FBI men from the North - Hackman (the bad cop, who used to be a town sherrif in the area many years ago but now  hunts bigger fish whether it be within the law or otherwise ) and Willem Defoe (the good cop trying to set the world to rights with the belief that even racists can't be all that evil to want to kill). They investigate the case using the rules laid out by the pragmatic and by-the-book Defoe. But the townsfolk aren't quite so co-operative or helpful and the two agents seem to spend more time arguing with each other over tactics or visiting burnt out homes, farms & churches belonging to the oppressed blacks in the area than getting any nearer to solving the crime. Even with a hundred other FBI agents brought in to help out both Defoe & Hackman find it hard to get witnesses to speak up and offer any leads regarding the three young missing persons. Eventually Hackman befriends the wife of one of the town's police officers (and suspected KKK member), wonderfully played by the ever-dependable Frances McDormand (of Fargo and Blood Simple fame). Through her Hackman learns that most of the police officers and leading townsfolk are KKK members and that the 3 activists were murdered & buried in a nearby quarry pit. With the bodies exhumed all Hackman & Defoe need to close the case are the murderers, but to get what they want they have to play by Hackman's rules this time..... A highly controversial film for its day (1988). Initially it was a certainty to win a host of Academy Awards for its virtuous storytelling. But various black groups protested that the film was flawed,uneven and possibly even racist. They also argued that the film portrayed the black townsfolk as defenceless, ignorant & backward, having to rely on two white FBI agents from out of town to help them win them justice. It is fair to say that they have a point. It struck me that for most of the time the blacks portrayed in the film were blatantly stereotyped as either churchgoers, gospel singers, cotton-pickers or ignorant illiterates. This major complaint coupled with protests from white Southerners angry at being seeing as just a bunch of hick rednecks, ended any realistic chance the film had of winning any award at all. British director, Alan Parker took a very simplistic view of some true events the film is supposedly based on. It is true to say that the acting from both Defoe and especially Hackman is top notch, the photography and film score excellent coupled with the overall pace of the film makes for a very entertaining viewing. However, it is to the content of the film that counts most and this is where Parker's limited knowledge of the civil rights protests in the Deep South during the early 60s is painfully obvious. I would guess that if the film was remade today one of the leads would go to a black actor of the quality of Morgan Freeman (replacing Hackman's character) or Denzel Washington (replacing Defoe's preachy, peace-loving act). At least this would've added far more balance & realism to the film without making it too overtly politically correct. Afterall why should cynical black townsfolk ever want to co-operate with white FBI agents. In their eyes all whites are just the same and to be mistrusted in equal measure. This film could have been better perhaps from an American director rather than from an ""outsider"" looking in. Parker is very much like Ridley Scott at times: all style over content without really understanding what it is he is trying to portray, which is a great shame. If one can forgive these flaws Mississippi Burning is a very good drama. Special mention has to go to the ever-dependable Gene Hackman who returns to form as the no-nonsense former sherrif who knows how the locals tick and isn't about to be fobbed off in the same way as the rather naive & clean-cut Defoe. Overall then, Mississippi Burning, fails to get its message across but entertains us nonetheless. The acting is good, the screenplay stilted and the characterizations are pigeon-holed. But for all that this film is worth a look because even though it is very uneven the main theme of apartheid, oppression & racism between black & white Americans is a good lesson for us all to think about and realise that over the last 30 years nothing much has changed. ***/***** ",0.0
1246,"Wonderful work by Williams; I remember seeing this movie in my American Literature class.  It was really great.  The actors were wonderful, especially Robin Williams as the college English professor.  One part I don't understand is when one of the students played a joke on the dean.  He pretended to make the phone ring and answered it.  He then said it was God.  The dean took him into his office and literally gave him a paddling on the butt.  Don't you think college students are a little old to be treated like that?  Besides, wasn't that unlawful or had no laws about that yet been passed in the 50's?  Watching this movie also taught me one thing.  It was a famous word (actually two) called ""Carpe Diem.""  I had heard of that little phrase for several years.  Now I finally knew what it meant, ""seize the day.""  A similar incident was used in the movie ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" (also starring Williams)  Mrs. Doubtfire spilled her dentures in her water and said ""Carpe Dentum; seize the teeth.""  This is truly every English teacher's movie and I recommend it to all of them.",0.0

""Mississippi Burning"" turned out to be a GREAT film! It's a powerful film.  It's a film about the effects of racism in a town during the 60s.  It shows how the conflicting viewpoints of some of the characters lead to devastating consequences.  Yet, in a town that practiced a code of silence, the ""rules"" were bound to be broken.  Among the highlights of this film are an absorbing story, noteworthy cinematography, and very good performances.  In all, it's an extremely good movie.  Surely, it's the best movie of 1988.",0.0

2571,"Unique movie!!!; While watching the Matrix I oberserved quite a lot of parallels involving the characters in the Matrix to the characters in the bible. - The main character, Neo, I thought represented Jesus.  Neo was known as the one and in the movie he was referred to as ""my own personal Jesus Christ"".  Jesus and Neo were both re-born.  In the movie, Neo was flushed through the tubes to resemble the re-birth.  In the bible, John the baptist baptized Jesus to also resemble the re-birth.  Finally, in the end both Jesus and Neo died, but both died for a cause.  Jesus died to save our sins, and Neo to died to save the Matrix. - Cipher resembled the character Judas from the Bible.  Judas was one of Jesus' disciples.  But not a very faithful one.  In the end he betrayed Jesus.  He told the guards that Jesus was in the garden and to go arrest him.  In the movie, Cipher betrayed everybody in the end.  He wanted to save himself and go back to living his normal life.  - Morpheus is much like John the Baptist. John the baptist is shown the the light, but he is not the light.  He is the one preparing the way for the Messiah.  Much like Morpheus, though you may think he is the one, he knowns that he isn't and he must prepare the way for the one.  He also has the power to find the one.  John, baptizes Jesus and Morpheus flushes Neo through the tubes, which resembles the re-birth.      In conclusion there are many parallels between the bible and The Matrix, which I have stated above.  Though I didn't strongly enjoy this movie I thought it was very interesting to see how similar it is to many characters in the bible.",0.0

71057,"I love it but who to share it with?; ""9"" is a brilliant and totally innovative work from Shane Acker with some possible evidence of producer Tim Burton's hand on it. Apart from the obvious post-apocalyptic and parallel universe statements, the plot drips with symbolism: from the occult, Nazism, biblical to myths, legends and archetypes. A sort of Star Wars meets Mad Max in Oz. It's impossible to say it's really authentic borrowing heavily from everything including the archetypes of Freud & Jung to the big-eyed cuteness of ET. (The characters also look like they are wearing the weird gas masks of WWII.) However, it is presented in such a way that it is possible to become absorbed in the movie rather than merely analyze it. Then, because it stays with you long after, the obvious continues to reveal itself. 9 is obviously the last (after him would have to come 1 plus 0 to make 10) and if the Source, the scientist, is zero (0) he can't breed with 1, but only make him in a masculine-leader image from his own soul or personality. In the Hebrew alphabet 10 is symbolized by yods. These yods or raindrops - some might say amoeba for the slow crawl of evolution - fall after the dead 'numbers' have transcended 'somewhere over the rainbow'. (Clever imagery of the addicted suicider Judy Garland image on the record). Yods are also depicted on the The Tower or Mars card of the Tarot symbolizing destruction of man-made objects with the iconoclastic intention of destruction and rebuilding, hence earlier references to Hitler's master race initiative. When 9 is left with the only female, wise and brave 7, she is the Princess Leia of the tale and they have their ready-made Cain and Able, the twins, in order to start from this barren Garden of Eden to populate the Earth again. These sweet and naive twins are the CP-30 and R2-D2 of Star Wars. The wise ""1"" is the King Arthur or Obi-Wan Kanobi, who has lost his vision for his people and also his eye sight. The Oz Scarecrow lookalike has his mouth sewn shut but yearns for a brain, however he is really quite intelligent but attributes this to No 1. The Beast is the snake, ghost and dragon of mythology; the boat that takes the dead 'number' on the river Styx is heading straight for the Underworld of Hades, via the Greek tragedy. The writer/director must have studied philosophy, occult, psychology, religions, astrology and so on before borrowing heavily for his film but presenting it in such a unique way that it makes compelling viewing and is 80 or 90 minutes of edge of the seat viewing. His craft is amazing Â– he has given the Souls jointed fingers and the need to stretch to straighten out their stiff little canvas-sack-meets-armour bodies to stand. With a tiny curve of a straight-lined mouth, a smile appears. The spiritual aspect of the movie abounds with images and references to the prophets and avatars, especially the sacrificial Christian lamb on the cross, although in occult symbolism they are fiery pentagrams Â– especially clever when used at No 5's funeral. The scientist in his God-like manner created 9 to save the world! Monty Python had the search for the Holy Grail, George Lucas had Star Wars and Harry Potter has his Hogwarts. Even Dan Brown has made his fortune with The Da Vinci Code. This movie is worthy of belonging with these classics.",0.0

I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody, its one of my favorite movies. You can watch it over and over again and it will be great every time. The movie is long but entertaining about 2 hours but its definitely worth watching. However the film is filled with swearing and lots of violence. So I wouldn't recommend the film to kids.

48385,"a great example of American stupidity; I am sure I am going to get comments on my summary name for this comment, but I don't really care. This movie was funny as hell, if you want a good laugh (and you are not sick of hearing people do their own Borat impressions) then go rent this movie and have a good time. There is a lot of really funny parts, a couple really stupid parts, then some parts that make you go ""if this wasn't planned ahead of time, they never would have gotten out of jail"". The reason I say it is an example of American stupidity, is that so many people IN the movie just didn't catch on. Once they did though, they were either angry, or too confused to do anything but go along with it. The fact that some of the people tried to sue Fox or any of the actors/writers just baffles me. If someone is filming you (regardless of what it is for) and you make a dumbass comment, you deserve to be exposed for the dipcrap you are. Suing them just draws more attention to you dumb ass. I laughed, I laughed harder, and I was mildly grossed out. All in all a pretty good time, just remember, some of it is only funny because so many people are so stupid.",0.0

It manages to do everything from making you laugh to making you jump, to making you think *Aaaw*(But thankfully not too much). During the first viewing, I was taken by it's ""Britishness"". Itwasn't very often that a movie's main action can take place in a pub! It was only during the second viewing that I saw that the script was actually very well thought out and clever. What impressed me was the fact that the zombies look incredibly convincing and the action scenes are genuinely exciting, which is made even more impressive by the film's budget.

1175,"Hilarious in a very upside down way; I'm not sure what anyone thinks of when they hear the genre surrealist black comedy. I know I had no idea what to expect from that when reading it in Delicatessen's synopsis. But after watching it I would have to agree. Delicatessen is just that. It's surreal, dark, and twistedly funny. It's the very first film from artsy French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and one of two collaborations between him and Marc Caro. Dominique Pinon, a Jeunet regular, stars as Louison, a clown who moves into an apartment building run by a fat lard of a landlord who also happens to be a butcher. Louison begins to fall in love with the landlord's daughter, Julie, and this stirs up a lot of trouble in this run down little apartment which is full of bizarre characters and is also smack dab in the middle of a post apocalyptic hellscape. What more could you want? Delicatessen is an odd film to watch. I honestly don't know what any of it means and I'm still piecing together what I just watched, but I'll be damned if I didn't have a great time watching it. It's incredibly strange, funny in a devilish and stomach churning kind of way, the kind of humor that you're not sure you should be laughing at, or you're a little afraid to laugh at. For some viewers it might just be a little too weird, but for those who know what they're watching it's nothing short of freaking awesome. Delicatessen is a visual treat that is cruel to the senses. It's creepy and confusing to watch, but you can't help but enjoy it. Nothing is normal in this film, hence the surreal aspect to it, and there's only a weak strand of reality running through this topsy turvy flick. But every aspect of the film fits this crazy mixed up world Jeunet and Caro have created. Everything from the odd scenery that all seems out of place, to the collection of strangely twisted characters that inhabit the apartment, it all fits right in with this world that makes absolutely no sense. Delicatessen is as funny as it is creepy and as entertaining as it is fascinating. As far as analyzing the film goes I'm lost, but I can definitely say that I enjoyed every minute of it. There's a lot about this film to still be deciphered, but that will have to come at a later date after many more viewings of this exceptionally strange film.",0.0

It's those little things that make Wallace and Gromit so much fun I guess. The sheep are being stolen from the farmers by the owner of a wool shop Wallace takes a liking into, and her (mechanical) dog.

296,"The perfect film; Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is pure perfection. Not only is it highly original, humorous it also has no plot holes. And that's amazing considering it's warped time line. It's quite rare to have a film so free of holes. The only thing I can think of is that the adrenaline needle scene is pure imagination. Mia would have not awaken from that because the needle would never pierce her chest bone. Everything else though is terrific. This film is much better than the rancid Reservoir Dogs that featured colorful but unnecessary dialogue. Pulp's dialogue had a clever way of foreshadowing future events in the film. Example: 1)The foot message scene including the discussion of the diabolical fate suffered by Tony Rocky Horror was a prelude to Mia's overdose. If Tony got nearly killed for touching Mia's feet, what would happen to Vincent after Mia O.D's? Another trick that QT has bestowed on us through his dialogue is softening our expectations for carnage and violence by having his characters discuss Royal With Cheeses and TV Pilots right before Vince and Jules quickly kill 4 guys in an apartment.

296,"Op-Ed; I don't know how many reviews of Pulp Fiction are on the IMDb website, but I thought I'd throw in my two cents worth. If you have the time or patience, go to my review of Mean Streets, Scorcese's classic hood drama from 1973. If Mean Streets made me feel icky, Tarentino's Pulp Fiction made me feel almost feverishly sick to my stomach. PF gave me cramps as I sat squirming through the buckets of blood, the sick humor, and all the talented and elegant film-making expended to bring forth this profoundly ugly movie. I'm not religious, but Pulp Fiction and its director's predecessor, Reservoir Dogs are almost . . . evil. I don't use that word lightly, nor do I feel particularly spiritual when I see movies, but this thing and its creator feel bad, just wrong. The best movie I have ever seen is Roman Polanski's Chinatown (Polanski isn't exactly a poster boy for virtue considering his notorious legal problems) and even though the bad guys win in Chinatown, Nicholson's J.J. Gittes is a virtuous man. Virtue defeated is still virtuous. Quentin Tarantino has created more than one film where there simply is no virtue (although Samuel L. Jackson's character makes an attempt toward the end of Pulp Fiction, the soul of the movie is a darkened husk by then). Pulp Fiction is a cheerless, hateful thing that finds humor in human beings accidentally losing their lives. When I saw it, I wanted to find out what all the buzz was about. When it was through, I was depressed, sad for the vermin on the screen and off. I've written that I like movies with grit and depth; my wife likes to be entertained. If you've never seen Pulp Fiction (or if you have and want to see it again), take my advice and rent something old and Disney. Or even Chinatown. At least there's somebody to root for.",0.0
527,"Worthy examination of moral complexity; In general, I do not rate Spielberg all that highly, primarily because of his history of big-budget garbage like ET and Jurassic Park - movies that appeal to the most base aspects of humanity - but I think that he redeemed himself with this movie. Firstly, if I were to be a cynic, I would say that the choice of the Holocaust as a setting for a drama that would establish Spielberg's artistic credentials is a little too obvious. I am not going to be a cynic, however, but instead will share a couple of thoughts that I have about the story. What I find is the most significant aspect of the movie is the way the character of Oskar Schindler fits nicely between his initial role as a war-profiteer through to his eventual role as a local saviour. What I am saying here is that the ambiguity which a number of you have expressed regarding the character of Schindler can be answered quite succinctly whilst simultaneously demonstrating that Spielberg had not established a character whose 'virtue' was defined at the outset and which was exposed to the evils of the Nazis. The most important details about Schindler are that he was a cynical, exploitative, manipulative opportunist who always kept his real motives hidden from others. We see glimpses of this in his relationship with his wife, and the introductory scene where he essentially establishes his Nazi support-base by presenting himself as someone who he is not, but, through a convincing performance, as a confident, wealthy and important businessman (which he was not at that time). Combine this with his tactical resourcefulness in securing the capital for his enamel factory from a couple of wealthy Jews and his entrance into the Jewish underground market, and we see that Schindler cements his position in the movie as a man of power through the use of cynical, selfish methods. The moral complexity of Schindler, however, comes when he uses exactly the same methods to secure the lives of his workers. If he had not been the cynic as I described, there would have been no way for him to secure a position in which he would have been able to save the workers. So for those who may have some qualms regarding Schindler as a man, the lesson is that the very vices that he had were precisely the reason why he was able to do what he did. To place this in the wider context of the Holocaust, what we learn through the movie is that in a situation that is so incredibly dire and hopeless, normal understandings about morality and virtuous character have no application. A genuinely 'good' man would have been powerless to resist the Nazi deathmachine; only a 'bad' man like Schindler would ever have been able to find a place within that climate to do what needed to be done to resist the genocide. This exploration of the dual-nature of vice, being reprehensible under ordinary circumstances (the fact that he was a failure before and after the war) but absolutely essential to do good in exceptional circumstances is, I believe, one of the most significant lessons that Spielberg portrayed in ""Schindler's List"". It was certainly a relief from the usual wholly good heroes that Spielberg seems to love in his other movies. Bravo.",0.0
527,"Simply the greatest historical movie ever made 10/10; Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Films like The Pianist, Life is Beautiful, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas n various others have all tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List. Direction is top notch. Cinematography was great. Editing was a bit lame. Found it a bit long.

66097,"Coraline; This Gothic animation feature comes from Henry Selick, the man who brought us THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas (1993), which is frequently mistaken as Tim Burton's work (actually Burton is only the co-producer and co-writer, as a matter of fact, Burton directed his debut animation feature not until CORPSE BRIDE in 2005). The dark palette of our indomitable Coraline's fairytale distinguishes itself from other light- colored Hollywood cartoons interwoven with motley kids-friendly visualizations and vapidly didactic tone. Since the opening scene, my expectation of being thrilled had been hovering high, and I baldly assert that its audience's threshold age could be much older, which should had been a deadly challenge for a mainstream animation, nevertheless the film conquered its demographic range and gained a sprightly success in the box office and a nomination of BEST ANIMATED FEATURE in Oscar 2010. Speaking of the film itself, the 2-D character-designing deserves some standing ovation, the wackiness resides seamlessly inside each of them. Meanwhile the narrative reflects a deep empathy upon everyone's own grown-up issues, such as there is no unearned harvest in the world, never believe something which is too good to be true. The voice cast is superb, I even could not recognize it's Dakota Fanning if I had overlooked the opening credits and Teri Hatcher carries a nuisance between her two opposite roles as real mother Vs. evil mother. One little complain here, I am still not able to figure out the whole cause and effects of the evil mother's ""button-eye"" plan, which lacks a plausible explanation for me to digest. Besides that, the film excels in every each way to be considered a successfully unorthodox innovator in its own category. P.S.

1246,"Carpe Diem!; Excellent! Dead Poets Society is extraordinary. It tells us about how influential a person could actually turn out be. The story can be summarized as follows: newly appointed English teacher changes his students' lives through his poetries. A number of teacher-student movies have come and gone, but this one is peculiarly striking, one of its kind. The movie capitalizes with multiple aspects, namely: a thought- provoking plot, some splendid acting performances and a very important lesson. Although the conclusion is tear-jerking, the movie for me, has managed to go over big. Majority of the performances were highly appreciable. Robin Williams as John Keating in the lead role was undeniably impressive. His way of portraying the character bolstered by his supreme dialogue delivery leaves you completely mesmerized. Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Gale Hensen and Josh Charles were commendable while playing their respective higher supporting roles. Other supporting roles enacted by Allelon Ruggiero and Dylan Kussman were moderate as well. Minor roles played by James Waterston, Normal Llyod and Kurtwood Smith were garden-variety. Peter Weir, the director of the film deserves special ovation for drawing out such an exquisite film. Screenplay by Tom Schulman was laudable indeed. There are instances in the movie where you think that it shouldn't have happened like that, but that's how things are in the real sense - Unpredictable! Cinematography is impeccable. Editing is fair. Music by Maurice Jarre is fair to middling. Long story short, this flick is not your ordinary run-of-the-mill. It's different and better. You laugh, you cry, you learn. And yes, seize the day!",0.0
4388,"The monster is gonna kill us...; Possibly the best of the entire ""Scary Movie"" franchise, in my opinion of course. And the reason for this is that the laughs are more bountiful and sincere throughout the course of this movie, and the spoofs are more thoroughly executed. But a big portion of the credit should also go to the fabulous cast, both returning cast members but also new ones on the cast list. Because people were really doing good jobs with their given roles and characters throughout the course of ""Scary Movie 2"". True to the spirit of the first movie, and the rest of the movies essentially, this is a hilarious spoof movie which has no restraints and respects no boundaries. As such, then there are many really funny scenes throughout the movie, and if you enjoy a good spoof movie that pokes fun at a lot of other movies, then ""Scary Movie 2"" is definitely well worth watching. Compared to the first ""Scary Movie"" installment, then this 2001 sequel offers more of a storyline, better spoofs, better effects and and all-round better cast. All in all, a more enjoyable movie experience. And I guess I enjoy this sequel more because the spoofs are based on some more impressive horror movies, compared to what was seen in the first ""Scary Movie"". Even the introduction scene which spoofed ""The Exorcist"" is enough in itself to make it worthwhile to sit down and watch ""Scary Movie 2"". That really was a great way to start off the movie.

Jackson fan, I'm saying that because he was the most interesting character in the movie and he was my favorite character. There are a few other really good scenes, but sadly I just didn't think that there were that many.",0.0
6537,"Great Fx, but is that enough?; This did not live up to my expectations for the Terminator series. Yes, there are REAL fx, and the crane scene is fantastic.  It's tough to beat the cgi of the matrix, but reality is a lot scarier than a stop action fight scene on a semi. And yes, the terminatrix is amazing.  Great acting and cgi, but the T-1000 in T2 just seemed to be a lot scarier.  She held her own, and tried to play the T-1000 style, but... Is it even possible to destroy her? The lines in T1 and T2 did seem like they were 'right on', but like the other reviews have said, T3 just seemed a little off here and there.  And just 'appearing' in a top secret base with weapons loaded is a BIG stretch. Did they cut a scene or two to get it under two hours?? I could watch T1 and T2 a few times, but I was disappointed with T3. All your base are belong to us.",0.0
527,"A feel good version of the Holocaust; ""Schindler's List"" is a disappointment.  Spielberg packaged the Holocaust for Hollywood, and we ate it up. By choosing the story of Oskar Schindler Spielberg gave us a version of the Holocaust that we want to see: one that ends happily.  We walk out of the theater feeling satisfied and breathing a sigh of relief that ""everything turned out OK in the end.""  ""Schindler's List"" is a story that is untypical of the horrible reality of the Holocaust, and it gives us the false sense that there were more Oskar Schindler's that rescued Jews. Throughout the film Jews are saved from catastrophe in typical Hollywood fashion:  Stern is pulled off a train bound for deportation just in time, a train full of women are rescued from Auschwitz when it is discovered they are ""Schindler Jews,"" an old man is not killed when the Germans' guns all fail to fire, the women are not gassed in the showers.  It is not that these things did not happen - but they are the exception.  These rescues strewn throughout the movie allow the viewer to feel relief that detracts from the reality of the Holocaust. ""Schindler's List"" is sentimental and, with its happy Hollywood ending, allows us to feel good about the Holocaust.  How sad that we have allowed a movie that falsifies the ultimate reality of the Holocaust to sweep us off our feet.  It has been hailed as ""the greatest Holocaust film ever made,"" but if it was the greatest - wouldn't it tell the truth in totality?",0.0
5816,"Potter Perfection.; Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is n absolutely fantastic movie in every facet. The main movie is very faithful to the book and the extended version is extremely faithful to the book. The main movie covers everything of importance to the plot in pretty much the same order as the book and the extended versions keeps even more elements, some of which improve how well the extended version captures the emotional depth of Harry's story. Daniel and Emma have shaken off their noviceness and show great acting improvement in their portrayals of the main roles as compared to Sorcerer's Stone. Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltraine are still fantastic as Snape and Hagrid. Sadly, this is our last of Richard Harris as Dumbledore as he died before this film was even released. Harris was clearly the better Dumbledore and captured the wisdom and grandfatherly mentor of the Dumbledore from the books so well. Then the new cast members are fantastic. In particular, Jason Issacs was PERFECT in the role of Lucius and brought out the ruthlessness and self supposed superiority. The pacing is good. While there are some ""slow"" parts, this is a story that some parts need to be slow in. This movie does a fantastic job of being slow in parts in which the story calls for it, such as when Professor McGonagall is explaining the legend of the Chamber of secrets to the class, and faster paced in parts that call for it, such as the Flying Car scene. The special effects/visuals are massively improved over Sorcerer's Stone. This is particularly obvious in creatures. As opposed to the cartoonish Fluffy and comical troll seen in SS, Aragog is truly scary, Fawkes is truly awe striking, and Dobby feels like a real character. And the set of the Chamber of Secrets itself is much more well done than the chess set and dungeons seen at the climax of SS. Another major plus is that this story, both book and movie, though it retains a strong child appeal element with things like Howlers and Flying Cars it is far less childish than SS and has more emotional depth. The story of people like Hermione, who are looked down upon because of their parentage/background adds more of an emotional twist to the story, as does the danger they face. This leads to another point: There is real danger and real tension in this movie. The tension between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle is palpable and becomes even more palpable when Tom reveals that he is Lord Voldemort. And whereas in SS it really felt all along as though everything would be okay and Harry would triumph, in COS there is a real feeling of danger and a real feeling of doubt as to whether Harry will be able to save Ginny, whether Harry will defeat Tom Riddle, and even whether Harry will survive the adventure in the Chamber of Secrets. A final point is that John Williams fantastic music. The awesomeness of this speaks for itself. I really enjoyed the piece on the DVD where they showed the scene of Hermione's return with the music removed. The scene feels far less fulfilling without music and it was interesting to hear Williams himself talk about this. This movie should not be viewed by preschoolers or kindergarteners because of emotional intensity (Hermione's petrification, the message on the wall about Ginny.) as well scary moments, such as the Aragog scene and the battle in the Chamber of Secrets itself. This movie is perfectly fine for kids in 3rd grade and older. For kids in grades 1-2 in depends on the individual. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an outstanding movie that earns its 10 out of 10. Make sure to see the extended version at least a few times.",0.0
1175,"Wacky, Creative and Dark; (Flash Review) This is a very bizarre film. Arguably a dark romance film. The atmosphere takes center stage as these people live in a world of dank gloominess. Understandably as in their world's food has become so rare that a satchel of corn is of high value. An apartment building is where the people of this film live with a butcher who sells a 'special' kind of meat. A new arrival comes there to work and falls for the butcher's daughter and conflict ensues. Scattered about the main plot point are peculiar little vignettes of the other residents and all seems to impact one other at key times. Overall, this film felt like Terry Gilliam was being the creativity as well the bold cinematography. Strange and unusual.",0.0
5816,"A good first sequel; Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts consolidates the successes of the first. It tells a self contained story well (introducing a new Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher as it does so, in the person of Kenneth Branagh's very funny narcissistic Gilderoy Lockhart) and introduces some characters and elements which are part of the larger picture - Lucius Malfoy and Dobbie the house elf, for instance, both destined to have future significance which is not apparent at this stage. As before, the technical aspects of the movie are fine, and the climax is particularly exciting. Most of all, though, the three young stars are noticeably better than they were in the first film, and the improvement is particularly noticeable with Emma Watson. She tried so hard in the first film that she was distractingly bad. Here in part 2, she has already improved to the extent that she is merely young and inexperienced. And she gets better from film to film.",0.0
4886,"Does For Monsters What ""Toy Story"" Did For Toys!; Monsters, Inc. We were all, at one time, scared of monsters under the bed. Shadows of clothes in the closet. Weird sounds outside in the trees. I remember thinking there were all kinds of monsters in my room - not as much under my bed as in the closet. And once again, Pixar, who brought us ""Toy Story"" 1 & 2, plays on both adults' memories and children's dreams, making it equally enjoyable for both children and adults. John Goodman voices James P. Sullivan, known as ""Sulley"" to friends. He is a big, blue, hairy monster with horns on his head and hands the size of a watermelon. Billy Crystal is Mike Wazowski, his wisecracking, one-eyed best friend. Both of these monsters live in Monstropolis, a world where monsters roam freely. Their city is powered by a rare source of power - children's screams. That is where Monsters, Incorporated comes in. At Monsters, Inc., monsters like Sulley and Mike open portals into children's rooms - through closet doors - and scare the children, capturing their scream in a little yellow bottle. Sulley is the top-scarer, bringing in the most scares. But Randall (the always enjoyable - even when animated - Steve Buscemi), a wormy, multiple-armed lizard-monster with the ability to change appearances to its surroundings, is jealous of Sulley, and will attempt anything to get more scares...even if it means taking a child from the real world and bringing it into Monstropolis. But after the child escapes, Sulley and Mike reluctantly look after it, all the while trying to get it back to the real world before Mr. Waternoose (the late James Coburn) and others find out about the incident... ""Monsters, Inc."" does for monsters what ""Toy Story"" did for toys. Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my ""Toy Story"" review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience's INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc.,"" but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for ""Toy Story 3"") and gives them the bare minimum. But that is straying off the subject. ""Monsters, Inc."" is one of the most enjoyable animated films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. I didn't enjoy it as much the first time, but I then bought it, and have since watched it many times. It is an instant classic. I will be watching it years from now, when I am old and frail and in a rocking chair. It ranks right up there with ""Toy Story"" 1 & 2, and all the OLDER Disney films from the 50's-70's. It has all the elements of a sweet, charming, emotional and pleasurably good-natured animated film. And, more coudos to Pixar: Thank you for not packing it full of the language and inappropriate content that Disney shoves into the dark recesses of their films nowadays. Not only has Pixar brought back the ""Family Film"" genre to what it should be, but it also redefines it. Pixar's animated films are some of the most thoughtful, imaginative and enjoyable animated films ever - not to mention 100 % family safe. Thank you, Pixar, for getting back on track. 5/5 stars",0.025
527,"This movie is ridiculously GREAT!; It is official. Stephen Spielberg is a G-E-N-I-U-S! Schindler's List is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. And I get around. I have seen A LOT of great movies. Liam Neeson (as Schindler) is phenomenal, except for one minor, over-dramatic scene, Ben Kingsley is (as usual) fantastic, and Ralph Fiennes does a frighteningly good job of being evil. The movie is beautifully filmed in black and white in order to be consistent with the time period, but there are a few artistic splashes of color for meaningful, symbolic ideas and images.

903,"Hitchcock's masterpiece.; My Take: Still one of the most effective and engaging thrillers ever made. An obsessive work of art as only Hitchcock could make 'em. Misunderstood and unappreciated upon its release, VERTIGO is now one of the most celebrated and much talked-about film from the master Alfred Hitchcock. Not even Hitchcock himself could create such an entrancing film as VERTIGO ever again. It's an unqualified success from the man well-regarded as ""The Master of Suspense"". VERTIGO isn't just a great puzzling thriller, it's art. Like a painting by a sophisticated artist, you stare ponderously at VERTIGO and you'll always find something new and intriguing to talk about it. Although criticized for being miscast in the role, James Stewart gives one of his best and darkest performances as John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, a former cop who had to quit the force due to his Acrophobia. In a chance of redemption, Scottie is contacted by an old college friend (Tom Helmore) to investigate on the strange behavior of his wife Madeline (Kim Novak). After this set-up, the movie takes a plunge into the deepest and darkest realm of Hitchcock pleasures. A knotty thriller and a romance with a twist, this is Hitchcock at his very best and most satisfying, but you may want to go back and see it again and again just to get the hang of things, but consider that one of the film's many pleasures. In a time where love is considered a powerful feeling, one that conquers all obstacles, Hitch also unveils the darker side of such heavenly feeling; love as a dangerous poison. One might say it's a case of Hitchcock baking his own cake and eating it, but it's more of letting out that skeleton in his closet; unveiling his innermost and deepest obsessions and raising it way up high for everyone to see. As a result, VERTIGO didn't do so well in it's day. But that just proves it: This movies way ahead of its own time. Had Hitch gone the wrong way, he might have lightened its tone and gave it a cheesy Hollywood ending. Had it been done that way, VERTIGO couldn't possibly be talked about as much today. After 30 years of absence, VERTIGO was re-released sometime in the 80's (along with other classics as THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY, ROPE and REAR WINDOW, now dubbed the ""Five Lost Hitchcocks"") with restored footage and sound. On DVD, Hitchcock's classic is better than ever, with first-rate picture quality and sound. You'll swear the movie has not been made THAT long ago. The picture is clear, making the film look like its brand new, and the new soundtrack is breathtaking (Bernard Herrmann's score never sounded so great!). This is a perfect treatment to a one-of-a-kind masterpiece that's bound to entertain and be studied for generations to come. Rating: ***** out of 5.",0.0
48385,"The Comedy Of The Year!; I waited for ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" of very long time.

Borat wont learns culture of U.S.&.A. ( :) ) , he shows Kazakhstan's ""culture"", but I think, that it isn't there, like it was showing on the movie. In movie I was with my mom and aunt.

527,"Excellent film, but flawed.; I found Schindler's List a wonderful movie.  It is one of very few movies which are watchable over three hours.  Moreover, one of even fewer which are moving, fascinating and entertaining over its three hours.  It comes second to La Vita E Bella in terms of presenting the real holocaust, though - not in terms of realism but because in LVeB, we care more about the victims. In SL, we care about Helen and Stern, but not too many others.  In LVeB, we care about the family, and so it is even sadder when the holocaust takes its toll on them.  The most powerful parts of SL are either the scenes without dialogue where we see mass suffering, or where Liam Neeson places his demands for Schindler's Jews.  The balance of sentimentality just wasn't right.  In most of Spielberg's work, there is too much (I did fear it and when we got shots of the children, I almost felt like walking away) but in SL there was not enough.  However, I gave it a 9, because the film as a whole was more than these flaws.",0.0
527,"A fantastic film that I had to see twice; I don't have to tell you that ""Schindler's List"" is an extraordinary and important film. Unanimous praise and celebration of a multi-award winning cinematic masterpiece should make it abundantly clear what a powerful film it is. To say nothing of Steven Spielberg's remarkable achievement of delivering in the same year the greatest box office hit to date with ""Jurassic Park"" and then the Academy's best picture and director Oscars. But everyone knows about that already. I saw this film at a second run cinema in my neighbourhood, which basically sold out each show of ""Schindler's List"" for the week it was running. When my wife and I entered the theater, there seemed to be only one pair of seats available in the whole place. Only after we sat down did we notice the guy in front of us was proudly brandishing a tall cowboy hat. We figured out quite quickly why our seats were available and thought we ought to explore our options. I very politely leaned forward and asked him if he was going to wear the hat during the show. With a friendly smile, the kind man in his mid-thirties assured us he'd remove it when the picture began. True to his word, he took off the hat when the lights went out. Rarely have I ever seen a theater audience so transfixed on the images before them. Complete devotion of attention from every patron. Except one. When the ""dude"" in front of us grew tired of the film, some twenty minutes into it, he attempted making out with his girlfriend who briefly complied but ultimately succeeded in pushing him away. A number of future attempts were met with decreasing levels of success. Clearly the subject matter on screen was far from romantic. Weeks later, art imitated life on an episode of ""Seinfeld"" when Jerry's friends and family are outraged at his similar behavior which was a result of having no privacy while his parents stayed with him. Back to our friend ""Howdy Doody"", who has failed in his amorous advances during a film about one of the most chilling, harrowing subjects in the history of mankind. When his attention span gave out, and I imagine some five year olds could put him to shame, he rested his head on the back of the seat and stared at the ceiling. He would periodically sigh loudly, a declaration of his utter boredom. Not surprisingly, he drifted away and soon began to snore. I did nothing of course, and resigned myself to the fact that I'd have to watch the film again. This unfortunate sort of thing is the downside of seeing films in the theater, which I am by and large a huge supporter of in general. You never know what ""Buckaroo"" you might be sitting behind, but my advice to you is simple. If you ever spot a cowboy hat, relocate. ",0.0

Vertigo is a love drama with a crime in the background, it is mind-twisting, but not so thrilling and exciting as the above mentioned. The long scenes without texts do no include or add horror. The audience becomes aware of the mystery before the main character does - but the end is still unexpected, that is so Hitchcock! And the role and place of music is so fitting and boosting the whole atmosphere. Luckily the film is not black-and-white, making it easier to watch and enjoy landscapes and fashion. Vertigo is highly admired by most critics, including Estonian ones, who have ranked it the best or second best film in the history of cinema.

I should of given it 10/10, but I only gave that to one film and that is Nicija Zemlja. I know, may be it should of been reverse but it will have to stay that way. I am so angry with my parents. That they brought me to this world. I am even more angry that I fathered Theodore and Ian. I so much agree with Branko Lustig, God does not exist. Why do we repeat same mistake over and over again? Create children in such numbers that they will become adults and then die either by violent death or in bed? I am so angry, that each night before I go to bed I yell Heil Hitler and Sieg Heil and Deutchelland uber alles. My neighbours think I am crazy, but I am not. I am just so so angry! Inevitability of dieing is always there. From the moment I learned about this world I knew we will all perish sooner or later. So many books were written and films made about Holocaust and WWII that there is not much to add. That word Endoslung is the word. The final solution! After we clear Germany of that pestilence, we will live in peace and have plenty. We will rise our Ariyan children and be happy, we will not work much, Eastern Europeans will work for us in our Lebensraum and peace will prevail on Earth. But it is interesting, those Ariyan children would grow up and die, where is religion in all of that? Nazis did not have the time to think about that. Croatia is closest to what we have to that so called perfection. But you know what, I would rather not live in that perfection, if that is how perfection looks. If those shits refuse to come to Branko Lustig*s screenings and they are afraid of the truth which he is now spreading like mantra: God does not exist! then I do not want to be part of that perfection.

903,"Overrated Ridiculous Sexist Rubbish; This was one of the stupidest movies I've seen. How anyone thinks this is a classic is beyond fathom. 'Scotty' rescues a married 'Madeline' from drowning and instead of getting her medical attention, he brings her - passed out - to his home, UNDRESSES HER COMPLETELY and puts her in his bed, naked. Two days and very little conversation later and they are suddenly desperately in love. Scotty forces 'Madeline' to kiss him even after she begs him to stop and runs away. The disappearance of 'Madeline' from the hotel is never explained, so the hotel keeper must have been in on the scheme? His friend Midge serves as little more than a semi-jealous prop. His stay in the mental institution is totally superfluous and pointless to the plot. He 'just happens' to see Judy walking by the same flower shop 'Madeline' would get her flowers from (that just happened to be carrying the same specialty bouquet she used to buy). Judy hides all the evidence of her crime from Scotty but then just 'forgets' about the dead woman's necklace (that was part of the plot to kill the real Madeline as she had sat staring at it in the painting for days), and wears it right in front of him...? Then (after submitting to a complete makeover to 'please her man'), 'Judy' accidentally flops out a window to her death when she is startled by a nun. Flopping out of Scotty's embrace, through a window, and over a ledge at least 3 feet from where she was standing. Scotty has to take a few steps to reach the ledge to look down at her, but she just tumbled out from the same spot? Then Scotty and the nun just stand and stare at her (presumed) corpse and 'The End'. The kissing was uncomfortably weirdly fake, the emotion was unnatural, the music was intrusive, and the plot was incredibly stupid. I thought it would never end. This movie is the epitome of 'overrated'. I went into this movie wanting to LOVE it. My mom loved Hitchcock, this was recently voted 'best movie ever', and I love San Francisco. Ugh. This movie was a complete letdown and I think the people who love it so much have very low expectations and/or are blinded by the 'classic' and 'Hitchcock' labels and their romanticism of the good old days of sexist tedium.

296,"Pulp Fiction: A Brilliantly Stylish Film; There is nothing out there quite like Pulp Fiction. This masterpiece directed by Quentin Tarantino manages to tell a story filled with quirks but held together by a slick sense of style. Tarantino's masterful directorial work is on full display here, with very iconic shots and fantastic pacing, helped by the movie's unique structure. The movie bounces back and forth between different stories and times out of chronological order, but the genius is that this lets Tarantino put the sequences in an order that makes more sense from an emotional level. Music is also used to great effect, typically in conjunction with editing to let the two really highlight each other. John Travolta does a good job as Vincent Vega, but the standout performance is Samuel L. Jackson's Jules, who steals every scene he's in and is extremely fun to watch. Finally everything is brought together by a fantastic script, filled with strange asides and rambling monologues that are as unnecessary as they are fantastic. A film to be remembered.",0.0

1080,"The Prime of Monty Python ...; 1969 was a great year for British comedy, the Benny Hill Show started and so did Monty Python's Flying Circus, marking the debut of the surreal comedy group featuring, in order of heights, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Michael Palin and the two Terries, Gilliam and Jones, and they were so groundbreaking they made the word 'Pythonesque' exist. But let's still play with numbers, 1969 was the debut and sadly, in 1989, untimely passing of Graham Chapman, marked the end of an era and annihilated any chance for further reunions. So the number '9' is pretty significant in the history of the group, and it's all fitting that the year that goes in-between constitutes the prime of Monty Python, because it was the year of ""Life of Brian""Â… and because, I believe this is the film that expressed their yearning to irreverent, absurd, surrealist but ultimately intelligent comedy to the fullest. And I put the emphasis on 'intelligent'. Indeed, it is commonly know that 'drama' appeals to the heart, while 'comedy' appeals to the intellect. We love to laugh because the mechanism that allows us to do so pass by the brain, and you can't fool it nor take any shortcut, it's a hit-or-miss, So it all comes down to one thing: if something makes people laugh and think, then if it doesn't make you laugh, think of the reason first. Obviously, ""Life of Brian"" didn't make everyone laugh, because scholars, religious, Catholics thought the movie made fun of Jesus. Well, if one thing, the film is about Brian, not Jesus, Jesus only shows up twice in the film and he's never mocked or ridiculed, his divinity seems quite undisputed on the contrary. ""Life of Brian"" is irreverent and has a rather nasty attitude toward religion, but let's make our brain work a little. I discovered the movie in Latin class, because the teacher wanted to show us the ""Romane, Ite Domum"", moment (which was grammatically accurate) and it was so hilarious we asked him to let the film play for the rest of the hour. I finished the film later, but I owe my discovery to Latin, so it's all fitting that Latin makes me understand the movie too, and here's how. Religion comes from two Latin words: 'relego' as reading a second time, and 'religo': assembling people. And this is what religion is about, interpreting things (reading again), and finding a sort of mystical strength and communion in unity. For the 'relego', you have the emblematic sequence of Bryan being taken for a prophet and no matter what he says, or he leaves behind, even a shoe, people keep on finding reasons to sanctify him. If he on an old man's foot and breaks his vow of silence, the crowd shouts: ""it's a miracle"", and they're ready to lynch the old man when he starts hitting Bryan. This is the 'religo' effect on crowds, and ""Life of Brian"" is perhaps the only film featuring a dialogue between one person and a crowd. And when people shout all in unison ""we'll think by ourselves"", you have the maddening effect of religion, and perhaps the only one truth of the film: a crowd is incapable to be rational. And that doesn't apply to religion but even the Judean Front rebels kept insulting the Romans while incapable to think of one negative thing the Occupation brought. That's exactly the sensitive subject ""Life of Brian"" is dealing with, it's not about Christ, it is about a context, a crazy contest where the value of one's life was so cheap people had to give a meaning to death, and vice versa. You have a foretaste with the hilarious stoning scene where most of the stoners, are women wearing fake beards, so not even women are immune to these practices. Nothing has changed much although civilization allowed people to wise up a little, but even religious guys should gentlemanly reckon that religion calls for more complex reactions than blind faiths, especially if these reaction make people laugh, and not even at the prophet, but just a misunderstood alter-ego. The film was funny and intelligent enough not to mock for the sake of mocking; this is why I maintain that it is the prime of Monty Python. I read some commentators saying it wasn't as funny as they expected, or not just ""Holy Grail"". Well, ""Holy Grail"" was one of the funniest movies of all-time, so it would have been difficult to beat it only four years later, but ""Life of Brian"" was busy with a plot, it did rely on Monty Python's usual zaniness (a surreal alien space sequence, the bargaining part, Pilate's lisp to the belly-laugh inducing Biggus Dickus part) but it told a story with a beginning, a middle and an end (""Grail"" has the two thirds right) and it even afforded the luxury to include a romantic interlude and one dramatic performance, not the least because it's Graham Chapman's. As the titular hero, Chapman is really the straight-man of a world that turned crazy, and his performance is integral to the film's appeal. While Chapman is the soul of the film (and the only member who doesn't go into hundreds of disguise) the other Pythons are perfect in their respective field, actors and director, and the one with a little more musical talent provided the film's (or the groups') upbeat signature song and one of the most memorable movies' endings. It is ironic in the context of the film, but while they're singing, and whistling, we can't help but think of it as a happy ending, because indeed, we should always look at the bright side of lifeÂ… and so should the critics. And maybe this is the second truth of the film. The song would be later performer during Graham Chapman's funeral and only the Pythons could make a sad event such a joyful moment, and this the intelligence of the heart.",0.0
296,"Not the classic that the critics say; I saw this movie on video, after hearing all sorts of movie critics praising Tarantino's masterful use of ""multiple narratives"" in this film.  I suppose I was expecting something along the lines of ""Rashomon,"" which was probably setting my expectations too high.  There are three story lines (two and a half really--the Tim Roth-Amanda Plummer story is not sufficiently developed), only one of which is really interesting: the final story, revolving around Bruce Willis.  And that story takes up maybe one-quarter of the movie.  The remainder is filled with the John Travolta-Uma Thurman story line, which would have been interesting in the hands of a more talented writer or director than Tarantino.  The most interesting character is Keitel's--a great movie could be made of him, but he is on screen for only about ten minutes.  Tarantino does a nice job of exploring the ""banality of evil, but the ""hard-boiled"" dialogue is more often artificial and embarrassing, and when he runs out of expletives, he resorts to violence. As for the multiple story line concept, it's wasted here.  Tarantino actually did a better job with interweaving multiple story lines in ""Reservoir Dogs"" (another flawed film, but for different reasons).  And regarding what's in the briefcase--ultimately, who cares?",0.0

5540,"Classical Gas Pass; Stodgy, overlong, and muddy, ""Clash Of The Titans"" exists and is celebrated by its admirers as the last cinematic platform for special-effects wizard Ray Harryhausen. Such loyalty doesn't obscure the fact, more commonly noted in today's CGI age but true in 1981, too, that special effects need to serve an interesting story to be worth seeing at all. ""Clash"" isn't interesting. It isn't even coherent. An angry Greek guy stands on a coastline, waves splashing extras as he chews the scenery and exposes his fillings while decrying his daughter's pregnant condition. To bury his shame, he sticks her and her son in a coffin and throws them into the ocean, which carries them to a magical isle where the boy, Perseus, grows into future ""L.A. Law"" star Harry Hamlin in his early beefcake days. Meanwhile, in an all-white space meant to be Olympus but more like a dentist's waiting room, a cross Zeus played by Lawrence Olivier decides to punish the father's murderous crime by, well, by destroying the father's city and murdering his subjects. ""Release the crappin'!"" Zeus cries out. Actually, that's kraken, a sea creature not part of Greek lore but an early chance for Harryhausen to strut his stuff. Some movies live on because they are good. ""Clash Of The Titans"" seems to survive instead on nostalgia, for the Harryhausen aesthetic of Sinbad and Jason and claymation stop-action fight scenes with skeletons when such effects had to be earned with something more than a press of a button. It probably helps to have been young and impressionable when the film came out, geared as it is to a juvenile audience with a robotic owl clearly modeled on that classic Greek demigod R2-D2. But the action scenes are not terribly gripping; even the Medusa scene praised by many here plays too choppy and inert. There's no interest in the characters; though Hamlin and co-star Judi Bowker are pretty to look at, they are given no more to do than recite threadbare lines with minimal emotion. The gods bicker and utter various profundities, with Olivier looking like he's being filmed between proctology exams and most of the other Olympians standing around looking concerned. Like Jamie Farr in ""Scrooged"" and Phil Silvers in ""The Cheap Detective"" Ursula Andress as Aphrodite has star billing and one line of dialogue. Maggie Smith pines for a mutant goat boy while Claire Bloom pines for the days she and Sir Larry worked on ""Richard III."" Either director Desmond Davis and screenwriter Beverley Cross were inept, or else they were under strict orders from producer Harryhausen not to do anything interesting that would distract from his effects work. The sets are bare, the outfits plain (togas over jogging shorts), and the secondary characters exist largely to be killed off by Harryhausen's monsters or else cheer when the heroes do something we are supposed to be excited by. Burgess Meredith plays up his wizened-but-puckish persona as a playwright who helps Perseus capture the winged horse Pegasus, then both coot and steed melt into the background. Greek myth stories have a lot of potential to entertain. They are the oldest surviving form of Western story, after all, and have been passed on a couple dozen centuries already at least, however updated and distorted. ""Clash Of The Titans"" could have been a nice popcorn return to civilization's colorfully chaotic roots; instead it dodders and pontificates, giving us a few peaks here and there at something greater behind its limp faÃ§ade, but never coming close to delivering anything worthwhile.",0.0

I also thought that the very, very ending of the movie is nothing less than perfect and I left the cinema with a desire to see the movie again. John Goodman and Billy Crystal were great choices for the main characters, but they could have done more with Steve Buscemi's character, if for anything because he has a very distinctive and likable voice.

Travolta is great in his comeback role, but Sam Jackson owns this film. One of the greatest performances of the '90s. As good as Landau was in Ed Wood, Jackson was even better.

296,"This will make you believe in God again; WARNING: EXCESSIVE FANBOY REVIEW Brilliance comes in many shapes and forms. This is Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, widely and rightfully hailed as a masterpiece by several people, and I happen to be amongst them. Whoever they are, they have good taste. It's tough to say what is so great about this, because there's practically a grocery list of things to choose from. Its idiosyncrasies are bold and pronounced, yet weaved perfectly into a story that is both funny and charming, never becoming stale and never missing a beat. The repertoire of actors on display here is certainly of a high pedigree (Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, etc.), and the way the stories are mixed and matched and jumbled up into the movie's steely exterior is done so masterfully that you don't even notice, blowing Crash and Memento (two films which I also lauded heavily, by the way) out of the water. Everything is perfectly in sync with the other stories and the way they come together is done so well that it gives me fits. I'd have to write a much longer review to detail every reason why this is so good, but that's unnecessary, and I'll keep it short: Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece, and as the credits roll, either your perception of films (and sometimes life in general) will have changed, or you will be lost forever.

296,"Royale with Cheese; I cannot speak for everyone, since many of my friends tell me that style of Tarantino's movies are just bloody mess. However, some parts are sense of genius which is told in movies of Tarantino. The same as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp fiction is just a bunch of dialogues and some strange episodes change. First time you see the movie, you will think of it as a strange move for telling the story. After I watched this movie first time, I didn't notice the beauty of the scenes, the dialogues and performance of actors. But re-watching it gives me so much joy and calm, that it became as therapy for me, that I do sometimes just to have a good feeling after watching an awesome movie. The other good side of Tarantino's style, and exactly Pulp Fiction, is that Plot is not really important to understand story. Nevertheless, it is just a good bonus for people. That's what I love in this movie, while other films are just good, but you can watch it by skipping like 70-90 percent of the movie, and read the plot on wiki. And you will clearly understand everything! Like some time ago, I watched Transformers on Spanish, when I was in Spain, and I understood everything, because dialogues and actor performance were just a bonus for plot and effects.

5816,"A Great family movie, that will interest 'Muggles' of all ages!; Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets. A Review by Joseph Gibson. The waiting of thousands of frustrated children and adult Harry Potter fans alike is finally over, as the sequel to the biggest grossing box office hit, finally comes to our screens. Many have been waiting in suspense for the past year with just the predictable and familiar hype for company. Yet I have to be honest, this time around, my own expectations were even higher! Though trying to keep objective about hype which with such a film is an obvious given, it was the self confession of a 'great film' by director Chris Columbus that really got me swept up in the Potter frenzy. So to the point Potter-rites, is this a good film? And the answer to this question (not solely due to my own bias having read and enjoyed the books) is Yes. However, like all budding critics, one must leave behind that easily satisfied eleven-year-old soul, and show that although it is a well-rounded film, there are still points of criticism, which cannot be ignored. For some, this film has seemed exclusionary, snubbing those people who did not watch its predecessor. Yet the main plot clearly stands separate to Philosopher's stone, and although this film's exposition doesn't deal with Harry's history for newcomers, it is not a totally perplexing experience because of this. Anyhow, why should a sequel accommodate an audience which in such a famous franchise, people know is a sequel? The story begins when Harry is warned not to go back to Hogwarts School through fear of something taking place that will endanger the life of our hero. In loving Hogwarts so much through hating living with the Dursley's in the summer holiday's, he doesn't heed the advice of house elf Dobby. When he arrives a series of strange and mysterious attacks start taking place, and Harry finds himself at the centre of a conspiracy. This film is far darker then its predecessor, and deals with more adult themes that will captivate an older audience as well as the already enraptured youngsters. However, it is also much funnier by a mile, with every scene containing jokes that are not just pragmatic but structural too, and one cannot help laughing out loud at certain points.  John Williams again, as in the first, accentuates this through a brilliant score, which fluctuates between comical and quirky tunes you will end up humming, to foreboding and menacing moments of music that capture the darkness at the movies heart. In the first movie, his score seemed to dominate the scene, drawing attention away from the film itself, but in the Chamber of Secrets it is not the case; an example of rectifying the mistake of dealing with all of the films elements too separately. This time around, Christopher Columbus show's a visual flair and a magical creativity that accentuates the backdrop of Hogwarts that the first film sadly lacked. The opening of the film has a sweeping shot over the Muggle County of Surrey, which slowly pans downwards to Privet Drive and onto the protagonist boy wizard himself. This wonderful shot, showing Harry's loneliness and alienation in the Muggle world, is one of many, rich and vivid in symbolism and imagination. It is not just the direction that has greatly improved in this film, but also its visual effects. Due to time restriction in the last movie, Columbus cut corners. This was noticeable, particularly in the Quidditch sequence, where it almost appeared that they had adopted the archaic Superman effect of placing broomsticks in front of a moving background screen. This time however, the graphics of the fast paced Quidditch game were cleaner and more believable, aiding the belief in J.K Rowling's imaginary game. Most impressive of all though, and to the relief of fan's, the C.G.I elf named Dobby looked best of all. He clearly displayed a range of emotions, and was very much an acting character as opposed to a reacting character. This is very befitting sentiments for the human cast also, as this time around, young Daniel Radcliffe, actually acts, giving a more rounded performance, and at certain moments shining as bright as the plethora of older supporting stars, who in the first movie, were his crutch and the movies soul. Joining the older cast, which is considered the cream of British acting, comes Kenneth Brannaugh as the Dandified Gilderoy Lockhart, and Jason Isaacs as the deliciously evil father to Draco, Lucius Malfoy. Both their performances were particularly great, and it can be said that fans will feel that both give an accurate portrayal of J.K Rowling's wonderful characters. It cannot be denied that Columbus had a very hard task indeed translating a book larger then the first into the confined length of a film, without omitting a deluge of classic moments and favourite bits from the Harry Potter world. It would be an impossible task to include everyone's favourite bits, what with Columbus having so much to choose from in the book. Yet it can be noted that although his attempts are admirable, there where many moments that were particularly treasured by fans and were felt important to the story, that found their way not into the film, but onto the cutting room floor. Columbus did however make some very wise cutting as well. The exposition of this movie is considerably shorter, steering into the action of the main diegesis straight away. It is fast paced (sometimes a little too fast paced,) but this fluidity does make it a much better film. Action is of course at the foreground of this movie, but it remains un-Hollywood-ised through J.K Rowling's imagination and intelligence, which is what truly carries the movie along. Harry Potter and The Philosophers Stone was a disjointed, incoherent film. Each scene of the movie existed separate to the rest, and usually stood for the soul purpose of 'trying' to amaze its audience with a particular effect or producing a crude and unsatisfactory insight into the Harry Potter world. This time around there is a definite coherency in The Chamber of Secrets, and disjointed scenes have been replaced with ones that do link together, yet you still cannot help but feel you aren't watching a 'real' movie. It is more a film that has tried to follow the conventions and restrictions of narrative upon the page, and has suffered as a consequence, producing something that seems limited and lacking in many filmic qualities. When we compare this film to other movies in the children's fantasy genre, it still wins first place for creativity, imagination, genius of story telling and of course popularity. Ask yourself, what else is available to children that are as good as these two films to date? Therefore, one cannot deny that as an example of a fantasy film in its genre, it rates highly on the scale of judgement. Those critics and cynics who deem the books better then the films must try to look past the impossible comparison of two separate art forms. The books are of course marvellous and highly detailed, but as an interpretation through film, I cannot help but Feel (leaving minor criticism aside,) that Christopher Columbus has succeeded in directing a much better film then the first. This in itself is a rare site- sequels aren't usually half as good as the original! It is of course no masterpiece. You're not going to watch Citizen Kane, but dare I say it, the movie is. FUN!!!

527,"worth watching; while watching i kept moved by this movie . .Few American movies since the silent era have had anything approaching this picture's narrative boldness, visual audacity, and emotional directness.The French author Flaubert once wrote that he disliked Uncle Tom's Cabin because the author was constantly preaching against slavery. ""Does one have to make observations about slavery?"" he asked. ""Depict it; that's enough."" And then he added, ""An author in his book must be like God in the universe, present everywhere and visible nowhere."" That would describe Spielberg, the author of this film. He depicts the evil of the Holocaust, and he tells an incredible story of how it was robbed of some of its intended victims. He does so without the tricks of his trade, the directorial and dramatic contrivances that would inspire the usual melodramatic payoffs. Spielberg is not visible in this film. But his restraint and passion are present in every shot.",0.0

527,"Spielberg's masterpiece; Schindler's list is a film that showcases the true horrors that occurred during the second world war, and manages to captivate them in the most realistic way that's possible. Although the film was produced in 1993, most of the film has been shown in black and white, which adds to the time period. This is a true masterpiece released by Steven Spielberg, and you can feel the emotion and fright from the actors involved. It must be horrifying beyond any recognition to live in such mortal danger as people did back in the second world war, but Spielberg exactly knows how to portray the story on the big screen, in a perfect manner. The film lasts longer than three hours and even looks like a live filmed documentary instead of a film, but it's truly magnificent and the story, especially the second half of the film, will really suck you into it so you never get the feeling it lasts too long. There's a deep message involved in the film, which Schindler makes clear towards his friend, war criminal Goeth. Power is not just control, it's to know when not to abuse your power. Or in a different definition, power is to know when to spare a life instead of taking one. That's what Schindler believes, and that's what makes him one of the most heroic Germans during the second world war. He was indeed a member of the Nazi party, but yet, he doesn't agree with the crimes that the German's commit against the Jews. During the film, your'e able to witness his growing envy of the holocaust and his fellow German Nazi participants. The first step he takes and when his true colors start to reveal themselves, is when he wants a Jewish accountant to run his company. The Jew, Isac Stern, tells him that Schindler might not be aware of the situation, since he's a Jew. We find out that Schindler couldn't care less, since he simply replies with the answer: ''Yeah, and I'm a German''. While the company is able to expend, more Jews start to come over to Schindler's company and start to embrace him like he's a saint to them, because the Jews that are able to work for him, are saved from death. After a while, when his entire company has to dissolve and his workers have to leave for Auswitzch, he buys each and every single worker in his company, to save them from the concentration camp. That's truly heroic, in my opinion. There's isn't a damn thing he could've done more for his fellow humans. All of the people in the company, that are on Schindler's list, are being transported to Tjesch Slowak, but the woman end up in Auswitzch due to a mistake made during the train transport. He saves them by handing the guard a couple of diamonds, and the women are able to head for Tjesch Slowak. Schindler tells the German guards they will not shoot without permission, nor enter the work floor without authorized permission from him. Stern tells Schindler that the company isn't doing well and that the Granate Shells aren't good enough which will inevitably lead to bankruptcy. Schindler again shows his true colors by simply replying: ''I would be very unhappy if my company would actually make decent grenades''. After the war is over, Schindler has to flee because he'll be seen as a criminal, although he certainly isn't in my mind, as well as in the minds of every single saved Jew from the 1100 he managed to save. Schindler falls down into tears, and despairs that he could've saved at least one more live. That's the moral to the story: How much is a human worth to you? That's something to think about.",0.0
6537,"Great action movie; - Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines: 8/10 At last, the movie I had been dying to see was released in Australia. Having seen the first two Terminators, but having forgotten most of what happened, I only had a vague idea what to expect. I liked the twist early on, which takes the story in a different direction than what the trailer may have suggested. This is everything an action junkie could want. It has great explosions, good battle scenes (way better than the overhyped fights in ""The Hulk""), but also has a good storyline. The comedy wasn't as intrusive as I thought it might be, and was pretty well timed. A lot of it was acceptable because it featured Arnie running off believable, but still comedic robot lines (although there were exceptions, the craziest being ""TALK TO ZE HAND!""). The female Terminator was BADASS, just relentless in her search, and NOT the blatent addition of sex appeal that she might have been. Without spoiling anything, this movie had one of the best last quarters in any recently, and the ended was almost mind-blowing and perfectly set up the next (and possibly last) installment of the series. As for the acting, it all seemed fine to me. Kristanna Loken was perfect as the T-X, and I liked the way she never ""broke character"" and threw off some stupid line. Arnold Schwarzenegger was as you'd expect - he can't act very well, so this role is perfect for him, where he can BE a robot, rather than unintentionally acting like one . Claire Danes was fine as Kate Brewster, though replaceable. My favourite role was Nick Stahl as John Connor, he was really good and convincing. Highly recommended!",0.0
66097,"Imaginative and Ambitious.; I went into the film as an avid fan of The Nightmare Before Christmas, which is of course also directed by Henry Selleck and not some guy called Tim Burton like every other person seems to think, including my film studies teacher. So I was hopeful and even a little expectant in what I wanted from the film. The trailers had hinted at an eerie sub-plot to the movie and this is carried out delightfully throughout the film. But sadly this main point of story is what detracted from the film, but only minimally. The opening of the film spends too much time lumbering over character and setting, showing the undoubtedly beautiful animation at its very best. But its pace was slow, and I felt that if a film at 100 minutes running time feels slow then there is a problem. Aside from this slight lack of cohesion the film was brilliant. It picked up pace furiously towards the climax, which is easily the best part of the film. Its characters were likable, there were a few funny moments, although no laugh at loud ones, and there was an enjoyable experience for all to have. Whether its for children being immersed into this gloomy environment or for adults marvelling at how beautifully and skillfully the film was made. I came into the movie desperately wanting to love it, but came out just admiring it wildly.",0.0
71057,"A decent effort in the increasingly popular genre; Animated movies are clearly 'in' these days and there is no reason to believe that the hype will be over any time in near future. With the pace of technological advance, actually, one would expect quite contrary. Anyway, '9' is one of those movies that are not really time-wasters but are neither memorable experiences. Storyline is pretty predictable, once the initial set-up is defined, while animated characters are not making some strong impact and are rather shallow. Luckily, they are named by number (the main character being 9) which makes it easier to follow the story;) One aspect of the movie that I enjoyed most is its visuals with its dark, eloquent, post-apocalyptic surrounding throughout the movie, which gives to it the defining tone and feeling. It's not as witty as 'Ice Age' or as emotional as 'Wall-e' but it is a decent effort in the growing genre of animated film-making. Story: 6 Acting: .. Directing: 6",0.0
4326,"Versatile depiction of reality - with evenly strong cast; This drama-thriller is loosely based on the FBI investigation into the real-life murders of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964, providing an additional value to anyway skillful plot (by Chris Gerolmo) and direction (by Alan Pakula). In comparison to other states, Mississippi was (and largely is) behind the times in many ways, and many crimes were launched or not disclosed due to overall mentality and indifference -- thus, community solidarity can have both good and bad elements. The movie shows how difficult is to investigate if people are at bay, and when certain activities are not perceived as felonies. The events are logical and catchy to follow, largely thanks to character actors like Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe, Frances McDormand, and Brad Dourif who make a difference even while being briefly on screen -- no cute faces or politically correct solutions, but harsh and effective methods for solving a severe crime. It is neither family movie not entertainment, but depiction of black spot in the US history after WWII.

6537,"Derivative action movie but perfectly entertaining...; Well, I have to say that I enjoyed T3.  It was not a taught B-movie thriller like T1, or a faultless big budget sci-fi classic like T2, but it certainly entertained for 2 hours without getting boring.  (I couldn't say the same of the other summer blockbuster I saw recently, ""Hulk"".  I had to see that twice to check I wasn't imagining how BAD it was the first time.) ***** contains mild SPOILERS ****** T3 doesn't really bother trying to explain why Terminators even continue to exist post the seemingly ""final"" events of T2, instead it attempts to capture the audience's attention, with the promise of some impressive stunts, action sequences and effects (right from the opening shot of a nuclear detonation), and a large helping of ""more of the same"". It certainly delivers on more of the same, with some great action sequences (T-X driving the crane was particularly good), nice effects, and constant pursuit of John Connor by a particularly mean, seeming unstoppable (and this time not unattractive) machine (apologies to Robert Patrick!), which again is defeated in an ingenious manner. Where it fell down for me was: 1)  it lacked the originality of either of it's predecessors, both in terms of plot, and in terms of set pieces (I guess there are only so many ways a machine can bash another machine into a wall repeatedly, but Arnie shooting up loads of cops then do a ""000"" count of human victims?  Surely we've seen that before!) 2)  it had a few too many attempts at humour (that is how we spell ""humor"" it in England BTW), which I think robbed it of the tension of the earlier movies.  For ever slice of ""talk to the hand"" genius, there was a dog line (""I'm back!"" was easily the worst). But overall, it was more fun to watch than a lot of blockbusters I've seen recently.  I'm not likely to hold my breath for the DVD, but i'd recommend seeing it, just don't expect to be blown away the way T2 would have done.",0.0

Set in a world that only Mr. Tarantino himself could imagine, Pulp Fiction tells the tale of small time organised crime. Beginning fantastically with the electric and meaty dialogue of Pumkin and Honeybunny, played be Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, Pulp Fiction's opening Diner scene acts as a prelude to the crescendo that soon follows. The characters of both Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, played skillfully by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, soon become modern day cinema catalysts for the punchy and fast dialogue that inspired a generation of young filmmakers.

I don't have a problem with nudity or political in-correctness. I don't have a problem with the way the movie exposes bigots; some of the people in the movie deserve being held up to public ridicule. But along with Cohen's deserved victims, there are too many innocent victims for my taste; people who are probably well-meaning but still be made to look bad. I found the treatment of the Romanian villagers particularly heartless. Overall, this movie just doesn't come together for me.

6537,"Money-grabbing rubbish; Wasn't the entire point of Terminator 2 that 'there is no fate but what we make for ourselves'? It was a good message, as humans have always had the tendency to deal with their anxieties by attributing inevitability or some sort of cosmic plan to future events. While this may be true, I find it most prudent to subscribe to the view that the future is not set and that it is in our hands. It allows you to live your life to the fullest and to die knowing you spent your life trying to make a difference. I loved the ending of T2. The sacrifices made by the protagonists have proved that future CAN be changed. Unfortunately, when a sequel promises a safe way to earn lots of money, it does become inevitable. So what is the message this time around? That future is inevitable anyhow, and no matter what you do the universe has conspired to entrap you and make you a helpless pawn in a grand scheme where life, death, even love are pre-determined. This is a rejection of everything the previous two (excellent) films have stood for. Having rejected the essence of the previous films, T3 goes on to reference more marginal elements from them, because that's what the audience wants, right? Give us Arnold as the Terminator, give us those beloved references. Let us re-live some of that past awesomeness! But it's a pale copy. The film does not feel genuine in any way, and it is less competently written and directed than the previous installments. The antagonist is a useless bimbo that is in no way menacing, and the protagonists are made to say stupid lines and either sit in the back of a van or run around aimlessly. So what is good about this film? Well, Arnold, of course. He is the reason we are watching this. The rest is just nonsense we have to endure so we can see Arnie do his stuff. And he delivers, although he can't do anything to fix a poorly written script. Going back to the script, now we learn that Connor's wife is suddenly a major player in the resistance, which was never even hinted at in the previous films. Moreover, their children too are important. You can just tell they are making up stuff just so they can squeeze in new characters and make it possible to extend this franchise forever. And the original myth about John Connor? Who cares. If we think we can make another sequel by inventing Connor's relatives, ex-wives, cousins, children, grandchildren, math teacher, pet dog, etc. we will shove these characters into the plot. As we have seen, T4 further distanced itself from the original film and now anything goes. As long as there is a robot that looks like a human skeleton in it, you can call it a 'terminator' movie and start making money. The bottom line is that T2 was the end of this story. It was nicely wrapped up by the creator of the original film and there was no need for a sequel, or a prequel, or a reboot. It's time for filmmakers and studios to start creating original stories and characters and stop cynically exploiting the original work done by true filmmakers decades ago. We need to start voting with our feet and avoid movie theaters in protest. Get yourself a blu-ray of the original film and watch it at home with your friends or family.",0.0

All the characters and landscapes are absurdly exaggerated caricatures that are also endearing, from French chanteuses eating frogs to urban development run amuck as commuter trains just miss old houses at full speed.  Virtually dialogue-free, the film salutes Chomet's cinematic comic influences, such as Jacques Tati, with visual tributes. The story, charming as it is of a grandmother's devotion to her grandson and determination to rescue him from kidnapping gangsters, is helped enormously by BenoÃ®t Charest's disjointedly jazzy score and especially by the eponymous singing group's signature song ""Belleville Rendez-Vous"" by Mathieu Chedid (available in both French and English on the soundtrack album).",0.027777777777777776

71057,"Definitely not worth a '9'....; What is it with CGI animators? I realise that things have come a long way from Toy Story, and we will always have the Dreamworks/Disney Pixar rivalries, but CGI animation is becoming more & more depressing. I'm not sure who he target audience of this film would be, and that is the big problem. The majority of CGI movies nowadays seem to know it's target audience pretty well. Young kids, and parents who have to watch the movie with kids. Take a look at any successful CGI movie, and the formula is the same. Colourful characters, snappy dialogue, and a few risquÃ© jokes that adults will chuckle at, and kids won't get. 9 has absolutely none of that. I do not think it is a kid's movie by any stretch of the imagination. OK, it's CGI, there are a lot of cutesy characters (mostly borrowing from a narrow range of stereotypes), but the movie is colourless, the subject matter (post-apocalyptic survival, loss of humanity over technology etc.), not to mention several death scenes, scary adversaries, and very little by way of humorous dialogue, would alienate most kids. I can't see it working as an adult's film either. It's too formulaic. You almost know exactly what is going to happen, and which of the group of 'Little Big Planet' rejects will not make it to the end. As with most big budget animations, the artwork & rendering are top-notch, but the premise is too bleak to allow for any development. All the locations look pretty much the same, (and unfortunately, so do many of the characters). The story takes a back seat to action scenes, and overlong periods of overt displays of CGI mastery until about half-way through the film, but by then it's too late, and the explanations for the existence of the sack-boys, and of the world is dealt with all in 30 seconds, before we are back to more action scenes and doe eyed puppets. OK, I will grant that I am presuming all CGI movies must be aimed at kids. I understand this shouldn't be the case. After all, Watership Down, & Animal Farm were examples of animation which were not really that child-friendly, but at least there was an elememt of morality with the tales they told. '9' doesn't really resolve itself that well, and it does end with a very nasty clichÃ©. Nice try, but there are better CGI movies that both adults AND kids can enjoy out there.",0.0
6537,"T3...?! Old' Jimmy Cameron must be laughing his ass off...; ""I'll be Back""... When those words were originally uttered in the classic original, many people felt a chill leap up their spine. Now ask yourselves...WHY? Was it because of the hilarious 'in-jokes'? Was it the amazingly over-elaborate 'set-pieces'? Was it the witty dialogue and Arnie's constant two-liners? Was it the awful mis-casting/bad acting? Was it the horribly inappropriate music? ...What's that, ""NO"" I hear you scream? Then why, OH WHY, does Terminator 3 reach down into the big stinking barrel of sequel clichÃ©'s in order to try and make this film a success? The plot is as this: Add Terminator 2 minus all the bits that build excitement and tension and you pretty much have it...except 'SPOILER ALERT' the fact they change the concept that you control your own fate, and merely replace it with the exact opposite. I honestly can't go through all the things that are so so wrong with this film, so instead I'll list the things that ARE good... ......... So there you have it. That was actually a lie for shock value, in all honesty, there are a couple of nice shots, and despite the third-world countries that could have had their economy sorted by the cost of the stunts, one or two actually come off not looking that bad, despite the constant trails of CGI Now I like Breakdown, and actually thought this film Â‘might' be half decent; I wasn't expecting the darkness of the first, I wasn't expecting the bravado mixed with storyline of the second...I just expected...well...something! No decent musical score, Stahl must make Furlong wish he were still higher than a kite, and poor old Arnie. My god he tries, you can see it in his face...but with probably the worst assortment of lines ever constructed for a man who also starred in 'Last Action Hero,' he must've read the script and thought 'Money Money Money.' No Linda Hamiliton, no Michael Biehn, no James Cameron, no Edward Furlong...even Guns N Roses were missed from this...probably worst film of the year. (And no, I haven't seen Gigi yet.) Please avoid, maybe then everyone will completely discount this, and a PROPER third instalment of the Terminator will be made. I for one will have my fingers well and truly crossed. By the way, I have never once come on IMDB to abuse a terrible film, nor have I jumped on any bandwagons or consulted other people's opinions. I just decided to write this review as a warning for those out there that still enjoy films on a higher level than tripe such as Â‘xXx' and Â‘Jeepers Creepers 2.' On a scale of 1-10 = 5. Must Try HarderÂ…or just not at all.",0.0
6537,"A big, and even cerebral, summer blockbuster as they should be done; Final Score: 8.4 (out of 10) If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I never would have believed it. ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" (love the subtitle) is lots of fun. It had all the ingredients of a disaster and appears to scream ""we are out of ideas and trying to cash in on a popular franchise"". Most repellent of those being the complete absence of original series creator James Cameron. Cameron is one of the best action directors working today - he just never makes any damn movies - and in the 12 whopping years since T2 has come out it has pretty much been the standard for big action movies. However, after seeing 'T3' and being surprised beyond my expectations, I'm not 100% sure Cameron's involvement would have made the movie that much better. This time Johnathan Mostow sits in the director's chair. He was another reason I was cautious about approaching this movie. I was under whelmed by his 'Breakdown' and viewed his last ""action"" movie, 'U-571', to dull to even scrape together a review for. Mostow does a phenomenal job. I can't give the guy enough praise. From his standpoint and from the team or writers assembled to script it 'T3' seems to be the loving work of fans of the original 2 movies. They work hard and meticulously not to screw things up. The end result is a movie that keeps up the spirit and integrity of the first film, but also branches out into being their own vision with it's own ideas for the next entry to the series. It has to be one of the best scripts built by committee for a 2nd sequel I've ever seen. A backhanded compliment if there ever was one, but come on - how often is the 3rd entry to an ongoing series (that isn't a trilogy) been any good at all? Mostow starts out cautiously, opening with John Conner's (Nick Stahl) narration. Before long we meet Kate Brewster, her father and the 2 terminators who will use Los Angeles as their battleground over these characters - all of whom come into play as important figures to the future of the human race. Our villain this time is a terrific original change from the other 2 films. What could possibly be more powerful then the menacing liquid metal Robert Patrick (T2)? A hot babe, of course. Ah, but beyond the human form of luscious Kristanna Loken the ""T-X"" (or ""Terminatrix"") is loaded with cool features & abilities - all best left for the viewer to discovery and some of which just about dropped my jaw with their creativity. When she and our obsolete terminator hero (Schwarzenegger) meet for the first time - it doesn't take long before we're neck deep in the action - what erupts is a car chase that rejuvenated my feeling of how exciting and fun car chases can be. The movie makes ample use of the fact that our lead characters are cyborgs. You can run them over, blow them up, rip them apart, pretty much anything and everything and the kitchen sink is thrown in this cocktail of giant machines and entire city blocks are demolished in the process. It is good old fashioned summer ride. The movie is exciting as a big (and I mean BIG) blockbuster actioner (more so then 'The Matrix Reloaded' was) and intriguing as a serious sci-fi movie with a few laughs thrown in when appropriate. Mostow wisely avoids the synthetic look of, say, 'The Matrix' and relegates the film to the earthy, realistic look of the first 'Terminator'. Which makes the action and destruction look all the more spectacular. The performances are pretty solid for a movie like this. It sounds like a cop-out when you say Schwarzenegger has made a career playing a robot, but the guy does it better then anyone. He's returned to form and I consider his slump (Eraser, End of Days, Collateral Damage, The 6th Day) officially over. Nick Stahl also does a fine job. He starts out as the burned out rebel John Conner and before it's over is able to make us believe Conner is gaining the qualities that will eventually lead him to save the human race. This progressive depth is diametrically opposite to Hayden Christensen's hollow, goofball young Darth Vader in 'Attack of the Clones'. Claire Danes is even better. Proving there is life after great TV shows get cancelled, she steps up as the strong female figure the series has been known for. She conveys that sense of sadness, anger and confusion of someone who is having her life turned upside down and in the 3rd act when she picks up a gun and fights back it doesn't seem as patronizing as in other action movies. So put away your preconceptions and go check it out already. It's a big summer blockbuster that loves to blow things up but also has a brain in it's head. And that ending... loved it.",0.0

6773,"A Fine French Export; Have a look at the negative comments about this animated film. A lot of them make the point that ""Belleville Rendezvous"" shows all Americans as grossly overweight. I think that these negative reviews may be written by Americans. Did they not notice the French cyclists who behave like dumb racehorses, the demented French accordion player, the callous French mafiosi or the fact that pretty much everyone in the film had something ODD about them? Let's face it, this film is intentionally and distinctly ODD. It's not to everyone's taste (my wife hates it) but to call it bad because it portrays Americans as fat is a little severe. Sylvain Chomet's film blends traditional animation and computer graphics very well and utilises the best from both mediums to good effect. The production design is highly detailed and this is enhanced by giving things like bicycles (notoriously difficult to draw by hand) a CGI makeover. My personal favourite moments are the pitiful accordion wheezing from the van stuck under a low bridge in Marseilles, an object lesson on how to catch frogs with a hand grenade and the sublimely ridiculous chase scene with the mafia in elongated Citroen 2CVs. Recommended to fans of the surreal.",0.027777777777777776
527,"fine work from a master who will never die.; (please ignore my previous comment as it contained some errors) Let me begin by saying that the thousands of you out there who worship ""Saving Private Ryhan"" should think twice about labeling it 'the best Spielberg film of all time'. Schindler's list is by definition a masterpiece and in my opinion Spielberg's finest work to date. Unlike SPR, it focuses on true events and not only uses true locations and dates. SPR has a group of men risking their own life to save one whereas SL has one man trying to ""save the world entire"". Which one is far fetched though? Both, you would say unless you are historically inclined and know that Oscar Schindler(Neeson) did in fact exist and save more than 1100 people during the holocaust. Miller and his team, although loosely based on true characters do not depict an accurate incident in the chapter of world war 2.Thus we find Schindler's List more gratifying to watch as a film but also absorb as a historical guide. The acting mind you, is exceptional in both cases and hadn't there been charming old Bennigni hopping and bouncing on the chairs of the Academy - Hanks would have certainly taken Oscar (forgive the pun) home to meet his other two brothers. Schindler's list is deeply moving, and in every scene you get the feeling that you are there living in that misery and thanking your lucky stars that you have pulled through another day. What is most disturbing (and equally ingenious of Spielberg) is the way the Jews are killed. Sometimes they are lined up and shot at to save bullets, other times they are wounded and then shot in the head to make up for the 'mistake' (the scene where the woman dies in the hands of her husband spraying her blood all over him after the shot, is one of the strongest in the film). But Spielberg's genius does not emerge through the portrayal of gratuitous violence. It emerges through the way he shows what HAS to be shown. At times he creates tension by NOT showing an actual death (like the scene of the boy who couldn't clean the stains out of Goeth's bath and then gets killed by his sniper rifle) or else when you think someone is going to die - and they don't (the rabbi ) such subtleties always leave us uncertain as to what is going to take place next and always leaves us on edge. The girl is the red dress contrary to what many think, is also a stroke of genius. Spielberg includes her for two reasons : 1) We are taken on a journey through which we can relate and through which we can feel what is happening around Â‘us'. Because she is marked her in red, we can easily follow her through the streets of the ghetto and not get lost in the violence which takes place around her. 2) She becomes a symbol of lost innocence when later in the film she is seen in a pile of corpses. Had she not been in red ( a very empathic colour) we might have not recognized her, or we would not have focused on the tragedy of her murder. When the flames later on in the film are lit to celebrate the Sabbath (notice they to are coloured) we get the impression that hope is re-emerging and good will triumph in the end. I particularly admire the scene where a German plays Mozart on a piano to the rhythm of stuttering guns being fired around him. This not only creates a macabre atmosphere but it also shows how cold blooded some Germans where (""is that Bach? No Mozart"").It is not surprising however that the film is praised in Germany today because most German's disassociate themselves rightly with the atrocities their ancestors committed against the six million Jews murdered.(one must notice the scene where the German soldiers decide to ""go home as men rather than murderers"", showing that not all Nazis where NAZIS, if you know what I mean.) The portion in colour at the end then, always sends goose bumps down my back. Probably because we are seeing real people (the actors and actual characters still alive today (well 1993) like {amazingly enough} the girl Schindler kisses at his birthday party!) The very last scene then, where the road built from gravestones is panned on and ""Directed by Steven Spielberg"" appears, has me sighing and thinking ""wow"". Add to all this a great character analysis (the typewriter's audition scene is amusing because we learn more about Schindler's character, and the scene where Fiennes says `I forgive you' to the mirror shows us how hatable he really is) and development throughout as well as a heart pounding score by John Williams and what you've got is a film which I would surely beat myself to death for not rating it: ***** (Excellent) so I will (rate it 5 stars that is).",0.0

Joe Pesci stars as the fast talking, foul mouthed Italian lawyer (who has never been to court). He has to try and prove that two guys, being on trial for murder didn't do it. Of course this has some hilarious consequences in which Vinny (Joe Pesci) does a fantastic role. Marisa Tomei plays the part of Vinny's girlfriend with a love for automobiles. The chemistry between the main characters is great and the jokes are fresh and really funny. One of my favorite characters besides Vinny is the judge, masterfully portrayed by Fred Gwynne.

If you are new to the Spaced fan club and have only seen Shaun, and enjoyed it of course, than I suggest you go out and get the Spaced DVD's or collection, as you will be surprised at the classic lines fitted into each episode and the movie parodies, which are the basis for the show, especially episode 5, series 1, the zombie episode in which began the idea for Shaun.",0.0
903,"Hitchcock's Best; Normally I would hesitate in dubbing one film a director's masterpiece, especially the likes of Hitchcock; but there's no doubt here. When I saw `Vertigo' for the first time, I was already well-acquainted with Hitchcock. I'd seen `North by Northwest', `Rear Window', `Psycho', and `Rebecca', each several times, before seeing `Vertigo'. Now having seen `Vertigo' several times, the jury of my mind is out. It's the best. The entire cast is at its best. Let people flap their lips about `It's a Wonderful Life', `Vertigo' contains James Stewart's greatest performance. His obsession even takes physical form, his eyes gleam with it, and his brow glistens with sweat in anger and in fear. His performance climbing the steps of the tower at the end of the film is magic. Kim Novak has hardly the resume of Stewart, but her performance even surpasses his at times. The way her face tightens in her sadness, she is even divine in the scenes where she is purposely distant from the scene. A seldom used Barbara Bel Geddes is also good. These two stars alone mean a great movie. But the plot, and the man who molded it, are the stars here. The quirky plot gives me chills from its air of creativity and ultimate excellence of being. This tale of obsession forces me to watch the film over and over, indulging in the plot twists every time. Incredible, innovative camera-work from the `master' make this one of the great technical achievements of movie history. What else to say? 10/10 stars.",0.0

527,"Spieldberg's Masterpiece; Schindler's list begins as the story of a man who believes he can use a war that takes millions of lives, and a Nazi regime that murders millions of innocents, to turn a profit. But as the story progresses he begins to see the human side of whats going on, not just the profit margin. After learning of the hardships of those imprisoned, and of the murderers who control the camps, he begins on a quest to try and save not only his soul but the soul of everyone around him, and to keep the flame of humanity lit during the dark destructive reign of Hitler. This is without a doubt the best film of Liam Neeson's career as well as the best film of Steven Spieldberg's career. It shows you how even during a time of chaos and evil, goodness can still be found. It also shows a level of character development that I've never seen in a movie before or after it was released. Without a doubt the greatest movie about the time period of World War II.",0.0
527,"A gritty and moving picture; Schindler's List should be a punishment: a chastisement for not reading your textbooks properly about the Holocaust: a horrible genocide in which more than 6 million Jews were killed: an immense population. It gives us a very visual outlook of the inhumanity which was faced in the concentration camps. Taken like a documentary with black and white photography, Schindler's List is scary because it is real. There is also this chilling background music composition mixing Jewish hymns (very, very solemn) and another sad score by John Williams. I watched this in my history class in case you were wondering. So, should you watch this movie? I am not recommending it to high school students who've already read ""Night"" or learned in depth about the process of Hitler's ""Final Solution"" unless they find it interesting. In fact, I think ""Life is Beautiful"" is a more uplifting movie to watch in order to heal our sorrow after reading about Auschwitz and all those treacherous Jewish ghettos. Oh yeah, the actors in Schindler's List were brilliant: very convincing. The setting was brilliant. The ending was in my opinion the best part of the movie, so if you start watching it, don't stop during the middle because of the atrocities.",0.0
8838,"This is Alice's story, told gradually. Good movie.; Ellen Burstyn was in her early 40s here, playing the title role of Alice Hyatt, 35-ish, by all measures a nice person who plays piano a little and sings a little. But she is in a bad marriage to an emotionally abusive man, and has a real challenge for a son. The movie actually begins when Alice is about 7 or 8, growing up in Monterrey California. The scene is not long, but interesting all in shades of black, orange, and red. Surreal. In modern times (1974) we find Alice trapped in one way, in a small New Mexico town, but liberated in another as her husband dies unexpectedly. After the funeral, she and her young son are essentially broke. But she promises him they will get back to Monterrey by the time school starts in the fall. To do that she will have to get jobs, but with her only skill as a so-so lounge singer, hardly a demand in small towns, she has a great struggle. Not only with the income, but also with the various men who attempt to get into her life. Kris Kristofferson is good as David, the only nice one she meets. Diane Ladd, the same age, is Flo, a waitress she befriends after they work together. Harvey Keitel, around 35, plays a 20-something Ben who romances Alice, but turns out to be the baddest of the bad, and she even picks up and leaves town quickly rather than face him again. I actually saw the movie for Jodie Foster who was a very tom-boyish 11 year old Audrey, who made friends with Alice's son in one town. It isn't a large role but it was fun seeing her in light of where her career has gone. All in all a good movie, it has not lost any of its impact over the 30+ years.",0.0
1246,"Great film, few flaws; Robin Williams demonstrates his versatility in this movie. He combines his talents as a comic -- the students appear to laugh spontaneously as he improvises and impersonates -- with a capacity to express seriousness, hurt, and even humility. He not only seems to understand very well his character, an inspirational and empathetic teacher with a counterculture approach in a school where the rest of the staff values discipline and tradition, but also to have a feel for classroom education. The young actors who play the parts of students complement Williams well. Williams does a convincing job as the unique educator who mentors as well as he teaches in part because his students come across very believably, whether taking risks with girls, trying to overcome shyness, masking fear with stubbornness, or struggling with a parent's disapproval. Only the situation involving Neil Perry's suicide, because of the script and not the performances, strikes me as unlikely, reminding me that I am watching fiction. Yes, teenagers have occasionally resorted to killing themselves when they feel rejected, unloved, or unsupported by the people most important to them, but Neil Perry's reaction to his father's rigidity still seems too extreme, just as his father's attitude seems too inflexible. I think I could have remained absorbed in the movie until the very end if Mr. Perry had responded to his son's successful theater debut with a tone of condescension and words such as, ""Now... you have had some fun as a dramateur, and that's all well and good, but your mother and I believe that it is time for you to become serious and practical about your future, as you and I have discussed."" Then Neil could have possibly reacted with resignation and some tears, or maybe could have avoided the trip home with his parents by hitching a ride and escaping into the city. He didn't have to shoot himself in the head. That act diminished rather than enhanced the believability of this story.",0.0

The plot revolves around Shaun, who is trying to change his mundane daily routine and improve his spotty love-life, when the country is suddenly hit by an all out zombie outbreak. The movie juggles comedy, horror and some romance and manages to deliver on all three of those.

The plot itself is very silly, and it follows the man (an absent-minded inventor) and his dog (who happens to be smarter than the man himself) on a trip to the moon in search of cheese. The plot is a little slow when compared to the other shorts, but it does maintain a level of interest. (I just think that the more recent shorts have surpassed this one in every way).

50005,"Man cheng jin dai huang jin jia--The Curse of the Golden Flower; I viewed a movie this morning, The Curse of the Golden Flower, and I would like to tell you what I think of the movie in my own words. I found the movie to be interesting. It is impossible for me to explain what the plot of the movie may really mean as the Chinese ethnicity is strange to me. The movie, I am sure is rooted deep within the physical, mental, and cultural characteristics portrayed by the Chinese race. The film is set in Tang Dynasty, 10th Century, on the eve of the Chong Yang Festival, the Imperial Palace is filled with golden flowers. The Emperor (Chow Yun Fat), returns to the city unexpectedly with his son, Prince Jai (Jay Chow) to celebrate the holiday with his family. The Empress (Gong Li) and the Emperor have a strained relationship as an unhealthy liaison has been going on between the Empress and her stepson, Crown Prince Wan (Liu Ye). The young men of the family become stressed to discover the Empress has been drinking a tea made of her husbands medicine. Prince Jai states, ""you will never drink father's poison again."" She becomes hooked on his strange brew of herbs and drugs. The palace is filled with the glamor and grandeur of the festival. Golden flowers fill every corner of the city as an army of Chinese rebels is forming. A battle follows and blood flows through the streets of the city. The battle no more than ends and the Emperor immediately puts the city to work cleaning the streets and replacing the city to its former beauty. The movie is filled with tears, death and dying. I hate to say that the Chinese are a violent people as I do not know that for sure. However, this is a bloody movie filled with bloody men. The musical score is beautiful. ""Do not cross the river as you will not make it to the other shore,"" the words are underscored as the entire movie is. You must read the words or you will not understand what is going on.",0.0
48385,"Oh Borat your awful but i like you.; Of all the movies I have laid my eyes on I would no doubt rate this the most pathetic comedy I have seen. Although there were parts in the movie that made me laugh, this was probably due to the the fact of how low the character stooped to generate humour. The quality of the film was not cinematic, it so much reminded me of your Joe citizen taking film of his holiday trip overseas, unscripted and unrehearsed. How this movie won Tony awards baffles me or approaching it more optimistically it gives us all hope that producing such mediocrity can be rewarded as the way it has. Maybe I am missing something, like a novice looking at some well renowned artist impressionist painting failing to see the comic genius of the the man. I like to think I am not missing anything, I call it for the way I see it, utter rubbish.",0.0
2302,"I could watch this all day if I could!; I don't know why this movie got so many bad reviews! Sure, I may be 14 and not exactly a political genius, but it was downright funny!! The lines were hysterical (this is where some of the spoilers are): Like when the other lawyer tries to see if what's her name is 'sufficient' as a expert in automobiles and she totally owns him with that answer about the engine thing! Or when Pesci keeps going ""I'm done with this guy."" And I've always been fond of Joe Pesci: he plays some of my favorite characters. Like the guy in Home Alone! He's just flawless, easily fits the part, and shows an overly cocky Italian man. It's just plain funny! Like is said, Tormei was great and she was just perfect for the part, the whole idea of an out of work hairdresser who's an expert in automobiles is really cool. I'll be honest, I am in LOVE with Ralph Maracchio, or at least when he was young. And he did a great job. I mean just the whole idea of a court case and this lawyer who's been trying to get a case for i don't what it was like 5, 10 years! Flawlessy done, good for all teens, but kids would laugh at it too and honestly, if I had to watch a movie straight for one day, I would watch this one. It just makes me laugh!",0.0

48385,"Funny satire; Sasha Baron Cohen is a comic genius. Borat is as funny a movie as I have ever seen. He is so convincing as an innocent from Kazakhstan who no one uncovers as a sly, undercover Englishman, that I am still amazed at the temerity of this lunatic. The opening scene where Borat is introducing his sister as the #1 prostitute in Kazakhstan is so over the top that I still haven't stopped laughing. He is equally adept at skewering religion, nationalism, and racism. Pamela Anderson becomes a quest after an episode of ""Baywatch"" on television. Our hero must find this perfect woman and marry her. The sequences that follow are brilliant, and Mr. Cohen risks his life frequently in this docudrama/comedy.

903,"Somewhat disappointing; Contains spoilers: Having recently seen and enjoyed Psycho for the first time, I had high hopes for this one.  While beautifully shot and generally entertaining, there were a number of plot points that were simply too far-fetched.  First, the ridiculous scheme to cover up the wife's murder.  Surely there was a much more convenient way to discreetly knock her off (cut brake line?) than a weaving a silly ghost story.  Next, Scottie falls in love and starts putting the moves on his friend's wife within a couple days of meeting her.  That hardly seems very Jimmy Stewart-esque.  Finally, the incomprehensible ending.  Why does Judy jump?  There is no evidence given that she's suicidal, although she can't be happy with the turn her relationship has just taken.  The sight of a nun approaching can hardly be spooky enough for her to desire to plunge to her death.  And Scottie doesn't even seem terribly shaken up about the whole business this time around.  Overall good, but strangely unsatisfying. 7/10, because it is Hitchcock after all and Stewart is always great.",0.0
527,"Lives up to the hype; Finally watched it. And, even with everything it's been hyped up to be, I was still impressed. I thought it worked best when it was just focusing of Schindler, and showing his growing reaction to the horrors around him, rather than outright showing the atrocities, but you can't really fault Spielberg for showing bits like the Ghetto liquidation scene, or the shower scene, because they're so powerful without really being manipulative at all. The only bit that really falls into emotional manipulation is the final scene with the rocks, which really took me out of the movie and was obviously a personal, not artistic, choice by Spielberg. I was also very surprised at how technically superb and inventive the film was. I expected the powerful impact, but I didn't expect some rather creative shots like the piano playing during the liquidation, or the distant shadow at the top of the long staircase. It's really a beautifully shot film, which is refreshing, because Spielberg could have easily gone for a gritty, raw feel and probably still got the same effect, but the near-noir like set-up made the on-screen horrors even more unbearable, due to their glamourized feel. The acting is almost uniformly excellent, from Neeson's gradual growth over the film, to Fiennes' unredeemably evil yet almost sympathetic villain, to Kingsley's quiet nobility, and Embeth Davidtz's rather underrated turn as Amon Goeth's housemaid. It's really a shame that the film won no acting Oscars, as it truly deserved some, especially Fiennes for his tormented performance. The story is not the typical ""exposition-build up-climax-denouement"" but I liked that, as you really didn't know where the story was heading next, and it gave the whole thing a sense of danger and desperation, much like what the characters would feel. This was probably the most well-known and well-received film that I hadn't seen, and now that I have, I have to say I'm not disappointed, though I don't know how many more times I'll be watching it. It really takes a lot out of you. Furthermore, despite how much I loved it, it's probably not even in my top five Spielberg films, which is really a testament to how many superb films he's made.",0.0
903,"Vertigo; This is meant to be one of the great films directed by Sir Alfred Hitchcock, after Psycho of course. James Stewart plays Detective John 'Scottie' Ferguson, he used to be a cop until he discovered his fear of heights, acrophobia which gives him Vertigo. He has tried to get rid of this fear but he can't. He is asked by Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) to keep an eye on his mysterious wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak). As he gets to know her, he sees resemblance to a woman from the past in a painting she stares at. He also falls in love with her, but their romance is cut short when Mr. Elster makes John believe that Madeleine committed suicide. After a little while, he sees a woman that bares a very close resemblance to Madeleine, Judy Barton (Novak, of course). He becomes very obsessive turning Judy into Madeleine, he moves quite far from his Mr. Nice Guy image. A very imaginative story that will chill and touch. Hitchcock's cameo is a man that walks past in a grey suit carrying a small trumpet. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Sound. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, James Stewart was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 13 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 12 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 61 on 100 Years, 100 Movies and it was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Films.

8874,"Funny and really entertaining, even if it is a one-joke concept it is one that works; I thought that Shaun of the Dead wouldn't be my style, I seriously thought I would hate it. But no...I loved it. Some parts do drag, especially the beginning which took a little too long to get going, but I loved the film's deadpan and offbeat style and effortless mix of undergraduate humour and hardcore horror. If you love blood and gore, you have found your match with Shaun of the Dead, and if you love offbeat and sophisticated humour delivered in a deadpan way you have also met your match. The cinematography is innovative and unique, the music just adds to the atmosphere, the screenplay is extraordinarily clever and hilarious and the story is original and well constructed. Another strong asset is the cast, Simon Pegg is just wonderful, and Nick Frost is hilarious. Then we have great actors like Penelope Wilton and Bill Nighy who are terrific as Barbara and Phillip. Overall, just a great film, although it is a one-joke concept it actually works. 9/10 Bethany Cox",0.0
1246,"Bright stars; In the heart of more prolific days, Peter Weir directed this bold anti-establishment gem, starring a conspicuously reined-back Robin Williams as the unorthodox English teacher John Keating - a name that sounds like a poet's, to match the man's passion for the passion of individual will. Williams would do more nuanced, angrier work in Good Will Hunting eight years later, but this was the movie that showed the world he was more than Mork. The real star of the show is Robert Sean Leonard as the tragic trickster Puck (AKA Neil Perry), whose father can't afford for him to fail, but who cannot live without his thespian dream. With a luminescence reminiscent of Jim Carrey (who would take the titular lead in possibly Weir's finest, The Truman Show), Leonard beautifully portrays the joy and agony of personal expression's vital extremes. As usual, Weir's aesthetic is classic yet distinct, never bellowing for attention but occasionally coming alive to provide an indelible image: a bicycle sending a wave of birds into the sky; a shy student spinning in a poetic trance; a tiny lost figure stumbling onto a frozen harbour. Maurice Jarre's ugly synth score is slightly jarring (no pun intended), but Weir is on hand to furnish his soundtrack with a series of well-chosen classical pieces, most memorably two Beethoven excerpts, including the possibly divine ""Emperor"" second movement, which helped burn Picnic at Hanging Rock into our brains. There's little subtlety in this Society, but there is a wealth of humanity and truth, and a boundless idealism, amounting to another fine fable in the canon of a modest auteur.",0.0
8874,"Gory horror, with a touch of humor.; I personally don't like horror movies. I'm sensitive when it comes to that.Call me sissy, but I got kind of scared after the movie.

It's not the movie, it's me. The movie was very good. It was a very good mixture of horror and humor. Also a tiny tiny tiny bit cheesy, but it was all in the humor. Definitely a funny movie that you can enjoy w/ your friends. I recommend this movie to anyone who isn't sensitive to blood, gore, horror. It actually wasn't that scary. You couldn't compare it to The Ring, or The Grudge or anything like that. But the movie was slightly scary, but funny.

1080,"Do You Think God Laughed At This?; The Pythons are back with 'Life of Brian'. This time they adapt the bible. This might be offensive to the religious but I thought it was hilarious and a clever poke at fanatics but even though some of the jokes are hysterical, many happen to be a little too crude and vulgar for some people. But, then again, that's the Pythons for you. 'Life of Brian' tells one linear story unlike 'The Meaning of Life' which featured a series of sketches showing the different 'stages of life'. It's not about Jesus, but a humble neighbour of his who's been mistaken for a messiah. Even after poor Brian's constant denials and refusals he is forced to be seen as a messiah and treated as one and this is a result of the people's blind faith. The only reason that I can think of why people of religious faith will find this offensive is because they lack a sense of humour.",0.0
4886,"Pixar's glowing reputation takes yet another step forward; First came Toy Story. It was cute, but lacked bite. The technology was new, and Pixar was still experimenting. Next came A Bug's Life. It was remarkable. Then came Toy Story 2. Even better! Now here is their fourth feature: Monsters Inc. I'm not sure that it's better than Toy Story 2, but at the very least it's equal. It doesn't compare with that film in terms of hilarity. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, is one of the funniest films of the past several years, if not the funniest. However, Monters Inc. has a couple of advantages over TS2 (and, I promise you, it is at least as funny as any other film from 2001). First, the animation is even better than TS2. What? What did you say? Shrek? Ugh, don't even mention that waste of hard-drive space. Monsters Inc. is simply gorgeous in its color schemes. And the movement of the characters is so smooth it looks almost as if it were just the best stop-motion animation ever created. In the film, there is a Japanese restaurant that the monsters go to that's named after the great stop-motion master Roy Harryhausen. I'm sure he'd be stunned at the accomplishment. Second, it has a couple of the most exciting sequences in animation history, especially the climactic sequence in the door room. That's a scene that'll go down in the books. And, third, it's perhaps the first Disney film since Dumbo to be touching, but not cloying. Although some people have told me that the one song in TS2 made them cry, I personally was cringing through that number. There's a scene in Monsters Inc. that honestly made me cry. Generally, that's not much. I'm easily moved. However, I don't fail to notice if a film is emotionally manipulative. That's not the case here. The only other Disney moment that really touched me that deeply is the ""Baby Mine"" song from Dumbo. I think that the only people who don't cry during that song are convicts on death row. I really loved the characters in Monsters Inc. The relationship that develops between Sully and Boo is truly touching. It's developed in a very natural way. And it certainly helps that Boo is easily the cutest kid in the universe, even if she's not real. There were a lot of ""aww""s in the theater, but they were coming from college students, not maddening parents trying to get their kids to pay attention. Oh! And did I mention that the film's villain is one of Disney's best? He's a chameleon-like monster named Raymond, voiced by Steve Buscemi. Sure, his motives aren't all that interesting, but I love the way he moves. It's amazing. And his face is so expressive, but not too expressive like the characters in, say, ahem, Shrek. As much as I would love to, I can't say that Monsters Inc. is a perfect film. There are a couple of flaws. The first fifteen minutes or so, basically until Boo wanders out into the monsters' world, are pretty boring. By this point, though, I was so amazed at the beauty of the artwork that I hardly cared. Also, most of the monsters aren't very interesting looking, that is, besides the colors. Raymond and the big boss of Monsters Inc., who is a spider-like creature, are the most interesting. Also, Billy Crystal's girlfriend in the film, a Medusa-like creature, with snakes for hair that copy her emotions, is very cool. Most of the other monsters are so cute that it's a wonder that they can scare children at all! (That's how they get fuel, by the way; children's screams power the monsters' world). Sully, for instance, who is the main character, more or less (the commercials concentrate on Billy Crystal's character more, for some reason; the logic must be that Billy Crystal is a bigger box office draw than big, fat John Goodman, a pretty insulting thought). Anyhow, Boo comes into the monsters' world because she thinks he is a giant kitty! We can't blame them too much for this, though. You know Disney would never produce a film that didn't have an ability to push their line of plush toys. Some of the monsters, though, are kind of boring. This is especially true with Mike, the little green cyclops ball played by Crystal. Sully could become a classic hero, and Raymond a classic villain, but it's doubtful Mike will stick in your head for as long. Crystal is, however, very funny in the film (and that might be the only time I'll ever say that!). He'll never be as boring as Shrek, nor as painful to listen to as Eddie Murphy as the donkey in Shrek. The story of Monsters Inc. is full of cliches, which is unfortunate. As I've been trying to point out, most everything else about the film is so inventive that it's not too noticeable, but it will never be unnoticeable. You'll see the revelation that the monsters have at the end two hours before the movie starts. Your youngest child might not figure it out, but anyone over eight will know as soon as it's humanly possible. There's also the kind of betrayal that's popping up so often now in animation, well, in all movies, really, that you can almost take it for granted anymore. And, heck, I would've predicted it myself if I weren't being so enormously entertained! If it weren't for these cliches, Monsters Inc. might have ended up earning the title as one of the best movies I had ever seen. Still, I'll never forget it! Now, what can Pixar possibly do to surpass this? 9/10.",0.025

527,"Another Overbaked Spielberg Production; This is yet another example of how Spielberg can kill an otherwise passable movie.  The movie contains some genuinely good, subtle moments like the shooting of one hiding Jew fading into a phrenetic piano solo during a pogrom or a close-in shot of bodies being burned that fades out to a view of smouldering bodies that looks like a gigantic landfill.  But, in general, the movie contains far too many scenes meant to tug at our hearts that end up demeaning one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind. The sole use of color for the little girl in the pink jacket wandering through the streets is meant to be poignant.  Instead, it is cloying and heavy-handed at best.  The scene of Kingsley and Neeson typing up the list of people to be saved is classic Spielberg garbage.  Neeson emotes to his best to keep exhorting Kingsley that they can save ""more.""  Come on - going into the operation, they clearly would have known to a fairly good certainty how many could finally be saved.  This movie takes melodrama to exciting new heights.

6537,"Coming from a sick fan who's been waiting a minimum of five years to see this film, let me tell you...it doesn't disappoint!; A little low-budget film named ""The Terminator"" hit the streets in 1984. This extremely low-budget actioner was about a machine ""terminator"" sent back in time to assassinate, or ""terminate"" the soon-to-be mother of the future world resistance leader, who would fight back against Skynet's machines who would fight for their dominance of the earth. 19 years later, and one sequel later, comes ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"" the massive differences between the original film being the budget, special effects, and action pieces. Being a long-time ""Terminator"" fan, of both ""T1"" and ""T2,"" I can tell you this baby don't disappoint. I have been one of those nerds on the Internet who had an old desktop wallpaper that said ""T3: Summer 2002"" on it. I have been waiting for this flick for years and years and years, a minimum of five years at least. When production finally started, and was delayed to 2003, and started again, I held my breath and expected the best. After the trailer I expected the worst. Now I got the best. This film blows you away, it's the best sequel of the year and James Cameron's absence from the film, though visible, doesn't hinder it. Judgment Day never happened. The world never got hit by nuclear bombs, the machines took over, and now a twenty-something John Connor lives ""off the grids,"" with no home, no telephone, no nothing. Just in case the machines happen to take over one day in the future and try to assassinate him again. Of course, the machines DO come back again, as without them there would be no sequel. One is a sexy terminator called the Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken), whose mission is to assassinate John Connor's future lieutenants and his future wife, a current veterinarian, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), since the machines can't find where John Connor is (that's where the off-the-grid stuff comes in handy for him). However, John Connor happens to meet up with Kate Brewster the same night the TX tries to kill her (and now him since he is a primary target for termination), but the T-800 model cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is also back to protect them, who has been sent back in time by Kate Brewster in the future after the protection cyborg murdered John Connor...in the future, that is...err...confused yet? Wow, what a thrill ride. Give me a moment to catch my breath. Action non-stop throughout, great special effects, everything. It's nowhere near as great as the first two films, but as far as summer sequels go, this ranks in as one of the best. Arnold is back in fine form after ""End of Days"" (I liked ""The 6th Sense"" and ""Collateral Damage""), and for a brief moment in the film (when he throws Kate into the back of a truck), the way he is outlined against the night sky makes him look just like he did in the first film. His haircut is very much the same in that shot. Anywho, he's back. Nick Stahl takes over for druggie Edward Furlong in this installment, and by George he is great! Claire Danes doesn't do much but scream and run around and look pretty, but there's more purpose for her being there than in most movies like this. Like I said before, James Cameron's absence from the film IS visible, but new director Jonathan Mostow does a great job of taking over from him. The film is lacking some of the human elements that made the first so great, and it feels more like a regular action blockbuster than the predecessors. ""T2"" set a new level for action films; ""T3"" is more of a follower than a revolutionary film such as the first two. The special effects are impressive, but just like all the other films out there nowadays. ""T3"" in no way is as vicious, dark, or amazing as the first two films, which are both some of my favorite films, but Jonathan Mostow has done a great job handling Cameron's baby, and it shows, making ""T3"" neither disappointing nor bad; it's the best film of the summer, and one of the best action films in a long line of dull flicks. And in conclusion, I can honestly say that he'll be back. Trust me. So stick around. When he's back, I'll be back. But for now, hasta la vista, baby. 4/5",0.0

527,"Amazing and inspiring; Currently hailed as one of the top ten films of all time, ""Schindler's List"" remains an amazing story depicting the persecution of the Jews during the Holocaust. If you ask me, the film is not truly about the Jews themselves. For me, the main part of this film deals with the man Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson, in what is possibly his best role) and the life change he endures by deciding to help out the Jews. He begins as a selfish man using the Jews to work for him so he can make a profit. As a result, he pays to save the Jews from Hitler's persecution so he can use them to work for him instead. A large number of Jews end up on his list (the list of the title) and come to work for him. By the end, however, he sees what he has done for them and wishes he had been less selfish and could have spent more of his money (which he now sees as worthless) to save the lives of more of the Jews. The scene in which he realizes this is my personal favorite scene of the film. This is where the movie is at. It makes us all wish we could do more to help. At over three hours long, this film can prove to be a bit long and slow at times, which is really the only reason I cannot call it perfect. Nevertheless, everything about the movie is perfectly well done. The depictions are very realistic and the acting is brilliant. Spielberg pulls it off once again. Hard to say if this should be the Best Picture of 1993, though. ""The Fugitive"" is my personal favorite movie and I would have liked that to win. Of course, it is a film like ""Schindler's List"" that truly deserves a Best Picture Oscar. Not one of the top ten of all time for me, but a must see for all. ***1/2 out of ****",0.0

6101,"Flawed but still fascinating (and quite grim)...; I watched this film when I was younger and loved it. Seeing it again after many years, it's still riveting, but it has flaws in it, mainly the motivations of Charles, the man who goes missing. Why was he killed so indiscriminately? It was a pretty well known fact that the CIA and the US were behind the 9/11/73 (yes, the Chilean coup happened on Sept. 11th), and as far as the movie goes, Charles was never threatening to expose what was happening. There's even a NY Times reporter in the movie covering the coup, and she's never messed with. Plus there was a coup attempt a few months prior to the September one, and it (obviously) failed. The country was also in turmoil during the Allende years (lots of strikes, some local, some manufactured by the Americans), so the portrayal of Charles as a naive idealist strikes as false. Plus 2 other men who write for a left wing publication that Charles does are arrested, one is executed, the other is set free. So why was Charles considered such a threat? The movie never really explains. Lemmon's character naivete works well (and it's one of his best performances). He's just a man who is looking for his son, and is outraged not only about his son and his son's fate, but of the sheer brutality (very well depicted in the movie) carried about by the coup leaders with backing from the US. Lemmon is a very proud American, so his beliefs are pretty much shot to hell by the end of the film, which shows the ugly side of US foreign policy. The official run around is in full swing and Lemmon's gets more and more infuriated at the lies and obfuscation of the US officials, and then it turns to fury as he discovers his son's fate. A flawed but still great movie. As a man looking for his son, the film works wonders thanks to Lemmon and Spacek. As a political thriller, it works less well.",0.0
66097,"Coraline made for kids...who are able to think...; I truly think this film shows that all kids aren't a bunch of video-game playing sloths ( i am a big gamer myself ). It has a storyline that must be followed in order to understand why certain events are happening. It doesn't just go for the cheap simple laugh of a Shrek or Madagascar. It uses fairly deep characters, with good character development to incise. And pulls this off without a hitch. It doesn't shy away from a few minor 3d scares either...something that i liked in monster house. All in all i think this movie works on many different levels. Kids and adults will enjoy. Your kids will have to pay attention to get it ( something missing from kid movies in the last decade ). The animation is top notch, and the 3d is absolutely perfect. The story is such where you actually care about it's characters, and there plight. A definite must see...",0.0

6773,"Awful. A total train wreck that is both a waste of time and money.; Hate is a strong word yet it applies here as I did hate this film. It was rather boring and just pointless. Anyone who says the animation was top notch and better than most Disney or Pixar stuff is on something. The first part of the movie is done in B&W which looks like something out of a 1940's Merry Melodies cartoon, the rest of the movie is done in color and looks a lot like the animation from the Beatles animated movie ""Yellow Submarine"" with scenery and characters all drawn in weird surreal type images. I found this type of animation to be out of place and really ugly ,not in a bizarre way, just in a cheap way. My other reasons for hating it are virtually no dialog which to some consider that an art form ,sure if you watch an old silent movie but not for a modern work, The characters are all portrayed in caricature or parody too. Americans are all drawn to be obese , Europeans are thin, guys who ride bikes have freakishly large leg muscles etc. I mean can we say contrived here. The Triplets start off as 3 young women singing in the 1920's or 30's , later in the movie they are shown in the present time as 3 old hags who eat frogs and cackle. Their involvement in this really long and drawn out plot of a Tour De France biker getting kidnapped is purely by coincidence. The grandmother blows a whistle incessantly throughout the movie and the Triplets try to sing ,rather badly of course. It's just a train wreck of a movie. Definitely not for kids or for that matter for anyone with decent taste. I'm sorry but I did not find it to be this masterpiece of an art form. If anything it comes across as one long boring bland waste of time and film. Paying 8 dollars for this is a tragedy.",0.027777777777777776
50005,"Best Chinese movies these years; As a Chinese, I didn't have a high expectation for this movie. Actually, director Zhang got a pretty bad reputation in China during the last few years. You can find millions of criticism for his previous movie on Chinese forums. However, I have to admit this time he is doing a great job. The story is excellent and the acting is almost perfect. The only ""problem"" is that it is not a traditional Chinese kong fu movie so maybe it doesn't attract west people much.

Then I started hearing all these incredible reviews and watched the trailer. I decided to go see it. I am glad I did too. The movie was one laugh right after another! The United States prides itself on being a politically correct nation. This movie lets us throw that term right out the window for 84 hilarious minutes. That is a big part of what makes this movie work so well. Borat Sagdiyev comes to the United States to try and learn as much as he can about our country and put it into a documentary for his people. The language barrier and the incompatibility of his customs with ours makes for a clash of cultures that will have you walking out of the theater with a smile on your face and wanting more! This movie isn't for everyone though. It has a R rating and rightfully so. If you are easily offended by crude humor or offended by politically incorrect remarks, you should stay far away from this movie.

38038,"It lacks slight charm of the original three, but overall this is a cracking good film!; There was something about the original three films that made them so special and delightful - probably the length of them. Unfortunately this lacks the charm, but it still ends up being a fun film. The bright, shimmering side is that our favourite plasticene figures are still doing a cracking great job, there is good plasticene animation used, there is a silly, but well-structured and entertaining plot, an exciting, fun adventure, a good plot idea (a were-rabbit and a giant vedgetable competition) and good new characters! As well as lacking the original charm, the only other slightly gloomy side of the film is that the humour, though good, is slightly overdone, especially compared to the original films. The popular Giant Vedgetable Competition is drawing near and Wallace and Gromit are helping control rabbits from eating any vedgetables, now they are Anti Pesto. They are doing a good job, but soon, there is danger afoot. A were-rabbit is nearby...

I'm sure I've forgotten some things, but just look at that list!  Plus the score really enhances the feel--I can hear the ""flight of Pegasus"" (my name, not the official one) music in my head as I write this.

He, meanwhile, has another girl, Jiang Chan, the Impetial Doctor's daughter, on the side. Intrigue follows, as the Emporer orders the doc to poison his cheating wife.

71057,"Imagination at it's finest!; I come from the school of early Tim Burton, and Jim Henson- two of my cinema deities from my earliest memories- and this is the first time in a long time that anyone has managed to touch on that magic for me. I'll do my best to convey what a fantastic movie this is, without really revealing too much of the plot- because I think that this movie is best experienced not really knowing anything. You come in the same way the main character does- not knowing anything of this world. While sitting in the theater, I recalled memories of the intensity and heart of ""my first movies"" such as E.T., The Secret of Nymh, The Dark Crystal, and Edward Scissorhands- movies that touched upon something that was at once so rooted in human emotion yet so fantastic and unimaginable. I can absolutely say that ""9"" is now considered one in that catalog of visionary and hallowed movies. Guaranteed some will have a complaint with the length (a seemingly short 79 minutes considering the scale and impact of the story) but I think that a movie can be an epic without needing to be over 2 hours long, or a HUGE amount of unnecessary back story and origins that's only purpose is to make the story SEEM grandiose. This movie is a complete work of art- from the obviously eye-catching visual style and composition of what you see, down to the basic story and character development that you feel. In 79 minutes this team managed to harness my imagination and senses without having to dumb-it-down for the audience, or use any of the old gags that many bigger studios seem to rely on to sell tickets (thankfully there are NO cheesy gross out jokes to appeal to a typical cable-fed attention span). Instead they took me to places that I had never thought of, but will never forget. My most respectful nod to everyone involved. Absolutely do not miss this one.",0.0
50005,"A 1950s Camp Fest; The best way to visualize this campy historical spectacle is to imagine Douglas Sirk and Sam Peckinpah collaborating on a 1950s decadent Roman Empire movie starring Clark Gable as the Emperor and Joan Crawford as the Empress. The story is set at the imperial court in fictitious 10th century China. The Emperor (Chow Yun-fat in a goatee, looking unnervingly like Charlie Chan), is the picture of Confucian rectitude and virtue. It's only a picture; with the aid of the Imperial Doctor, he is poisoning the Empress with a slow poison that will drive her crazy. The Empress (an imperious Gong Li) suspects that something is going on; she is planning a coup d'etat for the night of the Chrysanthemum Festival. As part of her plan, she is carrying on an affair with the Crown Prince, who is the Emperor's son by his deceased first wife. The Crown Prince is also carrying on an affair with the daughter of the Imperial Doctor; he doesn't know that she is personally in charge of slipping the poisoned ingredient into the Empress's prescription. Despite his active love life, the Crown Prince is a self-doubting dweeb who has never left the Imperial Palace. Meanwhile, Second Brother, who is the embodiment of martial virtue and filial piety, has just come home after a three year hitch fighting the barbarians on the frontier. He honors his father, loves his mother, thinks he's a better man than his half brother, and wouldn't mind being Emperor one day. Third Brother, still in his mid-teens, is shy and doesn't say a lot, but he has has mastered Yogi Berra's principle that you can observe a lot by watching. He has his own ideas and his own ambitions. Meanwhile, the Emperor is beginning to think that the Imperial Doctor and his daughter Know Too Much, and he personally knows a good deal more than he's let on. Then the First Mrs. Emperor turns up alive, revealing secrets that upset a lot of apple carts. The sets and the clothes make the court of Louis XIV at Versailles look like a trailer park, and I, for one, had never realized that 10th century China had mastered the tavern wench style push-up bra a thousand years before Victoria's Secret. We get opulent palace interiors, gorgeous costumes, hordes of groveling male and female servants, elaborate rituals, midnight gallops, shocking revelations, stunning betrayals, stabs in the back, ninja assassins, acrobatic swordplay, both individual and en masse, and blood splattered everywhere. It's all done in the gaudiest, most saturated color imaginable, with a particular emphasis on gold and crimson. At the end, there is one person left standing. The servants come out, sweep up the dead bodies, sluice away the blood and put out fresh flowers. The Chrysanthemum Festival goes off with barely a hitch. If there is a moral, it is that appearances must and will be preserved at all costs. It's all empty calories, like cotton candy, but if you like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing you'll like.",0.0
6537,"Enjoyable for the wrong reasons; (Spoilers ahead) Anyone expecting this film to build on the T1 and T2 legacy (I was) will be disappointed. However, the film as its own entity is one of the best action films released in a long time. Looking back, it seems inevitable that T3 should go this route. In T1 we had genuine fear and desperation as the ""unstoppable"" terminator stalked its prey. In this respect T2 sold out the original for the sake of a good action film packed full of special effects. Admittedly T2 had a good plot including addressing the destiny/fate dilemma and the hope/despair of mankind's future. So where then will T3 go? Risk going back to the gritty original and alienate all the T2 fans? I think not. T3 moves forward into the action genre. Big fights, fancy weapons, glittering effects - none of these disappoint. The plot gets too caught up in the ""it's your destiny"" loop and doesn't really explore any of the time dilemmas. The ending is inevitable but leads us nicely on to T4. So, given the drawbacks mentioned above, did I like the film? The answer is a resounding ""yes"". Once I realised that this film should be treated as a *Terminator Action Franchise* I sat back and lapped it up. On leaving the cinema and felt contented that I had been well entertained for 2 hours. I must take a paragraph to talk about the humour in this film. This IS a funny film. While not normally a fan of dumb humour, I did laugh out loud at several points. The dead-pan deliver given by Arnie is excellent and well-timed and fitted well with the feel of the movie. In summary, you must watch this film if you like action movies with interesting storylines. It's entertainment without being an over-the-top action flick a la John Woo. Throughly enjoyable and recommended. 8/10.",0.0
527,"Schindler's List is a masterful blend of direction, cinematography, scope, score and performances, resulting in an epic of overwhelming power that only a cynic would dismiss.; WWII and The Holocaust were events of mind bending statistics and proportions. Tens of thousands dead in single bombing raids, 20+ million Soviets dead, 15+ million Chinese dead, 6+ million Poles dead, 7+ million Germans dead, 11 million the victim of Nazi genocide Â– it just beggars belief. The European and Pacific theatres were so dreadful, so massive, that it's impossible for one to fully process it emotionally. Schindler's List is one of the finest cinematic depictions of those dark years; a sweeping, brutal film that brings a remarkable story to the attention of millions of viewers. However, as with all historical films, it does not serve as the definitive source of information. The film follows Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a Sudeten German businessman who reaped the benefits of slave labour during WWII. With his imposing presence and magnetism, he charms his way through Nazi circles, soon operating an enamelware factory in Krakow, Poland using Jewish labour. At this point Schindler appears largely indifferent to the persecution all around him, or rather he avoids confronting the ugly truth of the Nazis' approaching final solution. He eventually becomes acquainted Amon GÃ¶th, the callously evil commandant of the PÅ‚aszÃ³w concentration camp who is performed excellently by Ralph Fiennes. GÃ¶th was an incredibly violent man, the extent of his crimes were such that his sentencing was phrased as following: 'Amon GÃ¶th himself killed, maimed and tortured a substantial, albeit unidentified, number of people.' GÃ¶th's violence isn't sugarcoated in the film, he shoots dozens of defenceless people and never shows even a modicum of remorse, so fanatical is his hatred for them. The film is starkly brutal, there is no cinematic sheen, the scores that are shot bleed profusely as they fall to the ground like rag dolls. Fiennes, whose face can be both that of a mild-mannered Englishman and sinister villain all at once, delivers a performance that's nuanced and restrained yet hauntingly evil. Just like an inundated office worker, GÃ¶th complains to Oskar about the pressures of the job, which at the time is the exhumation of thousands of rotting corpses Â– 'Can you believe this? As if I don't have enough to do they come up with this? I have to find every rag buried up here and burn it.' Like Adolf Eichmann, the logistics man responsible for the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews, Fiennes' depiction of Amon GÃ¶th is another example of Hannah Arendt's phrase 'the banality of evil'. It is a compelling depiction of one of the Third Reich's most committed defenders; a man deeply entrenched in Nazi ideology that has lost almost all humanity. The relationship between Schindler and GÃ¶th and his SS cronies is quite uneasy for the viewer. Schindler enjoys pushing the boundaries, he thrives off being a renegade, in one scene he kisses a Jewish woman in the presence of a whole party of SS officials. As the film progresses and Schindler realises both the abhorrence of the situation and his power to do something about it, something of a good vs. evil dichotomy arises. Deriders may say this is a simplistic construct, but it isn't, they are two complex characters. Their exchanges shows that Schindler is the strongest leader between him, he has personality and charm, whereas GÃ¶th only has ruthless barbarism, something GÃ¶th realises and struggles with. The film has grand scope and several brilliant set pieces. A notable example is the 'Red girl' scene during the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto, it is very impressive logistically, there are countless extras who all need directing. Schindler, who is atop a hill witnessing the brutality below, is the camera's point of view, following this little girl in a red coat (famously one of the few moments of colour in the film) as she navigates her way through all the murder and pillaging. The scale of the scenes at the PÅ‚aszÃ³w concentration camp is also considerable, particularly as great masses of prisoners, naked and completely dehumanised, are shuffled around like cattle for inspection. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski said that the film was shot in black and white so it would look 'timeless'. I think the colouring achieved the desired effect, and I also think the film's visceral edge and authenticity was achieved through the hand-held, shaky cinematography that would later work so well in Saving Private Ryan (1998). A great film will almost always have a great score, and it is no different with Schindler's List as Spielberg once again found a masterful auditory companion in John Williams, whose beautifully melancholy score, particularly the central violin melody, has become instantly recognisable to many people. The depiction of the mass exhumation at Chujowa GÃ³rka is set against 'Immolation (With Our Lives, We Give Life)', whose stirring operatic vocals and chords make the scene almost apocalyptic. There is also notable use of Hebrew music, such as the ebullient Yerushalaim Shel Zahav and the haunting Oyf'n Pripetshek/Nacht Aktion. Even the trailer leaves a huge impression through music. 'Exodus', a work by the celebrated Polish composer Wojciech Kilar, has a brooding subtlety that emphasises the trailer's ambiguity, making its two minutes and twelve seconds most moving and unsettling. Despite massive universal acclaim, the film inevitably had its detractors, most notably Stanley Kubrick, who said: 'The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. Schindler's List is about 600 who don't.' Firstly, around 1200 were saved, not 600. Kubrick suggests that 'Schindler's List' is somehow a sugar-coated account of the Holocaust, it certainly isn't. It is a true story, Oskar Schindler really did save 1200 people, it isn't a fanciful, maudlin figment of a screenwriter's imagination. It is an emotionally affecting yet tactful depiction of both the systematic murder of scores of defenceless people and a complicated man's remarkable act of humanity in the face of unimaginable suffering. 97% www.hawkensian.com",0.0

""No Mercy, No Shame, No Sequel.""  But it's amazing what a good run at the box office can do, huh?  I thought to myself, ""They can't make a 'Scary Movie 2', there is nothing left to spoof!""  But I have been proven wrong.  ""Scary Movie 2"" leaves nothing out.  They spoof everything from ""The Haunting"" (which has been begging for a spoof...) to ""The Exorcist"" to ""Hollow Man"".  I was even more amazed to find that ""Scary Movie 2"" kept the same level of humor as it's predecessor.  The only difference is, the plot is worse.  MUCH worse. But, if you are spending $7.00 and expecting a plot from this movie in the first place, then you are in need of some serious help.  The target audience for this movie is not interested in a plot, rather, how many boob shots Tori Spelling has and how many sexual innuendos can be squeezed into an hour and a half movie.  I should know... I'm one of them!  And with such actors appearing as James Woods, Chris Elliott, and, of course, the great Tim Curry, this movie cannot possibly flop.  No matter how bad the plot.

5816,"The ""Harry Potter"" installment that I really remembered; I have grown up with ""Harry Potter"" and as preparation for the last film, which is going to be shown this week, I am going to be re-watching all of the previous films this week. It is Harry Potter's supposedly 2nd year at Hogwarts. But a few days before he is supposed to attend school, he meets Dobby, an house-elf. Dobby warns him not to go back to Hogwarts for strange and terrible things are going to happen. Harry doesn't heed Dobby's warning. He continues with his original plan- attend school in Hogwarts. But maybe he should have listened to Dobby, for strange and terrible things did indeed happen- things that involve the mysterious Chamber of Secrets. I don't know what it was about this film that made me remember it the most from all the others I watched when I was younger. Maybe it was because of the mystery that it gave. (SPOILERS:) I remember being really scared of the basilisk scene. (/SPOILERS) It's a wonder that I didn't feel scared while going watching it. I guess things do change. In this film, I enjoyed practically everything. I enjoyed the mystery that it gave. I enjoyed the school work that it showed- simple things like Professor Sprout's class, the Quidditch match (of course), and even Gilderoy Lockhart's class. (SPOILERS:) In the succeeding films, that's one factor that I miss the most. The simple school work that this film (and the previous one) showed. It just made Hogwarts seem like an actual school. (/SPOILERS) And most of all, I enjoyed the satire and humor. Rupert Grint was hilarious, without even trying. Props to you, Rupert! This film has a long run time- 160 minutes. However, I must give props because it certainly didn't feel that long. I didn't feel bored while watching it in 2002 and I certainly didn't feel bored while I watched it again today. This film, along with the first one, showed the less frightening and less dark times that Harry experienced. It's only going to get darker from here. I'm excited. Viewed on: July 10, 2011",0.0
6537,"No Sign of Termination; If all action movies were as much fun as this one, perhaps I wouldn't hate the genre so much. I suppose it helps that I'm already familiar with the back story and characters, but I think more important are that it has just enough intelligence, and assumes that the viewer does too, plus plenty of humour and even wit. Fears that the lack of the James Cameron panache would be a severe setback proved ill-founded. It's a great roller coaster ride, but perhaps just a shade less so than T2. And here's something I thought I'd never be saying ... Arnie is so good. His deadpan delivery of some of his hilarious lines is  just spot on, and he even makes you feel the confusion of the man-machine faced with moral dilemmas. In fact, in a role that is really just a high tech version of Frankenstein's monster, I'd say he even gives the great Boris Karloff a run for his money. And the ending this time leaves us in absolutely no doubt that Arnie (and the others) will be back. Unless he becomes Governor of California, of course.",0.0
5540,"Fun film, who cares about appearance?; Alongside ""The Dark Crystal"", ""The Last Unicorn"" and ""Jim Henson's Storyteller"", Clash of the Titans has to be one of my all time favorite films of the past. This movie follows the life of Perseus, from the time he was a child to his destined quest to free Princess Andromeda. It follows the classic Greek tale very well. Sure, the SFX may be a little outdated, but it still is more believable than the SFX used in the recent Star Wars films. Too bad movies like this don't get made much anymore, due to the PC, Barney loving public whom want everything sugar coated and dumbed down. I also wish ratings of movies would not be so strict these days, because the nudity in the movie is *gasps* not sexual and *gasps again* not horny teenage nerd material that gives nudity a bad name. If you are into mythological films, give this one a try. But just to let you know (especially for the SFX hungry crowd), keep an open mind when watching it and give it a chance. You may like it.",0.0
66097,"Every Story Has Two Sides To It; ""You probably think this world is a dream come true, but you're wrong,"" said the cat to Coraline. This warning to Coraline (Dakota Fanning), in the film Coraline (2009), is something she has had in her head since the beginning. The director, Henry Selick, has made other mother movies that are also stunning. Richard Roeper compares Henry Selick's work: ""Writer/director Henry Selick follows The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach with another meticulously crafted visual gem."" This movie is visually stunning which intensifies the creepy scenes and leaves the audience frozen. The movie Coraline is all about a girl who moves into a new home with her father and mother (Teri Hatcher). He life is boring and dull and her parents pay no attention to her. Coraline is not able to do what she wants and explores he new house and finds a small door. However it is all bricked up, but that night she finds the door again and the bricks are gone and she goes through. Coraline gets to the parallel world and meets her ""other"" mother (also Teri Hatcher). Everyone in the world has buttons instead of eyes. Her ""other"" mother and ""other"" father treat her as though she is the best thing in the world. Coraline is amazed with this other world and when she falls asleep she wakes up back in the real world. She thinks its all a dream until the next night where she goes back and she is faced with more wonders made by her ""other"" mother. She loves this world and never wants to go back to the real one. To make a good horror film it was said that, "" . . .  by the time you get to the climax  . . .  your familiarity with the beast allows you to assess them in a different way"" (Fear in the Dark: A Spine-chilling History of Horror Film). Coraline fills this criteria and is a good horror film. I don't think it is for young children or people who are looking for the biggest thrill but it is creepy in its own way. Overall Coraline sends great societal messages and a cute but creepy movie to its audiences and both children and adults with love the horror and thrill for a long time.",0.0

5816,"Potter Fans Will Be Pleased: for the most part it's better than the first; Note: I tried hard to not include any spoilers in this post so if you haven't seen the movie yet I think you'll be ok reading this message, although if you want to know absolutely nothing about the movie before you see it maybe it's best that you don't read this post! Thanks! Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second movie in the series of at least three to be made based on the books by JK Rowling, is for the most part far better than the first film, ""Harry Potter and the Philosophers/Sorcerers Stone."" Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson (Harry, Ron, and Hermione) have become more comfortable in their roles. They are obviously starting to relate to their characters more easily. This definitely makes the film more enjoyable and more enthralling. Rupert (Ron) is definitely the best of the 3 at playing his part. He certainly has become Ron. Several new characters were added, including Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), who is incredibly convincing at his part, Dobby the House-Elf, who was CG'd so well that he really came alive on screen, there really was no way that I could tell he was computer animated, and also Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson), the ghost of the girl's bathroom who was EXACTLY as I imagined her in the book. The story was much more exciting because hardly any time was wasted on explaining who the characters were, etc. It moved at a very, very rapid pace- the 2 1/2 hours went by quickly! I think most of the people in the theatre also got really into the movie- hardly anyone got up, moved around, etc., even though the theatre was mostly full of young children. It was also much funnier than the first film... although I do have a few critiques. There was a lot more drama and violence and the ""scary"" parts, such as the spiders in the Forbidden Forest and the basilisk in the Chamber, were almost overkill. I thought maybe these ""scary"" scenes were a little too violent, a little too dragged out, and made the film seem even a bit darker than the book. It was, however, very powerful and got the message across that as cute and as happy as Hogwarts is there is definitely a dark side. And maybe I have really underestimated how ""dark"" the books actually were intended to be. Anyways, I am very pleased... it was kind of disappointing that my favourite parts of the book- the Deathday party and Valentines Day weren't included- but I understand that the movie would have likely been 5-10 hours if they had included everything from the book! Although I definitely wouldn't complain if the film had been a bit longer. 3 hours would have been ok with me! I think my favourite part was the Burrow (the Weasley's home)- definitely very, very cute and whimsical and homey. The Weasley family were very well portrayed in the movie. I had been looking forward to seeing the filmmakers' interpretation of their residence. Unfortunately Oliver and James (Fred and George) didn't have very big roles. Neither did Mark Williams (Arthur Weasley) which was unfortunate because he was brilliant as Mr. Weasley. Of course everyone except for the ""trio"" had rather small roles in this movie because as I said the story was definitely rushed along a bit and therefore a lot of the wonderful dialogue from the books was lost, even more so than in the previous film. Chamber of Secrets will please all of those who are die-hard Harry Potter fans. Of course, you cannot expect the film to live up to the novels by JK Rowling- they are what hold the true magic of Harry Potter. Both this film and the first are just a means of interpreting the books, not to replace them altogether. Do not go to this movie if you have not yet read the book- trust me, you will probably not enjoy it or appreciate it. Also, do not go to this movie and expect it to take the next Best Picture Oscar award home. However, just like the books audiences of all ages will be able to appreciate this film. Parents who have read and enjoyed the books with their kids should really have a great time watching the movie. In fact, it was the adults who were laughing and really immersing themselves in the show, while the children in the theatre were mostly just sitting in their seats, quietly spellbound. Pre-teen girls seemed to enjoy Dan and Rupert. All in all, considering the fact that I don't think it would really be possible for anyone to do a better interpretation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on the silver screen, I give it a 9.5/10.",0.0
5816,"Not as good as the first, but still good; I commented on the first HP movie ages ago, without having read the books. Now that I've become totally addicted to them, I just have a little to say about this. As my summary says, it's not as good as the first, but it's still good. The story is exciting and the special effects are great. Rowling's world is beautifully recreated and the story is enjoyable. I spoke about the actors in my other review, but, being now familiar with the characters from the books, I can offer a more rounded view. Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter. There's no doubt in my mind. The producer who discovered him for the role said he felt as though Radcliffe had a very old soul, and I agree. Harry seems to me to have the same trait. I'm glad Daniel will play Harry in the Goblet of Fire. I'm quite enjoying watching him grow up actually. I was disappointed to hear that Tom Felton won't play Draco in film 4. The scene in the Slytherin common room was just great. He was so icy and menacing in the way he said ""As for me, I hope it's Granger"". And again, Richard Harris will be missed. I really hope Michael Gambon (another Irishman, you may not have known) does a good job in The Prisoner of Azkaban, which I'm really looking forward to. Book 3 is my favourite, so I hope they did it justice. And it's nice to see that the title wasn't changed to suit certain audiences this time around. Let's keep it that way, shall we?",0.0
5816,"entertaining, recommended, but lots of shortcomings; I recommend the movie.  I give it 8/10.  However good an entertainment value it is (music, setting, special effects, excellent to adequate acting, etc.), it should not blind us to its shortcomings. The scenes of any good movie should emphasize the main plot (the detective story - clues, red herrings, etc.) and the background, character and motivations of the characters.  Some occasional comic relief might help. The problem with this movie is that it is more like a variety show - a bunch of unrelated acts, acts that don't build on each other, that serve no purpose other than some quick entertainment, or inconsequential scenery (for example, showing what fun the school and magic are). *****SPOILERS*********** I saw the movie twice.  The second time, I took along a stopwatch and paper for notes.  The movie without the end credits is 2 hours and 30 (or 3l) minutes long.  The end credits are about 10 minutes.  I figure that almost an hour of the movie didn't contribute to the main plot in any significant way.  In the first 28 minutes of the movie (ending with Harry's arrival into the weeping willow tree) the only thing useful to the plot (and was not in the first movie) are two slight and brief scenes that could have (and were) duplicated/ explained later on  --  Lucius' ranting about mudbloods and his putting (rather openly, it seemed to me) the diary into a student's bag.  It took 41 minutes (from the start of the film) for the mystery to begin - Harry's hearing voices in the hallways.. .. The technically wonderful quidditch match was a waste, plot or background-wise; it took up 6 minutes or so.  (A lot of critics have criticized the spider cave incident as a wrong turn that accomplished nothing (about 10 minutes), but every good story can have a red herring.)  The following are some other incidents that did not contribute to character, background or detective plot: time with Harry's muggle family and the Weasleys, Dobby, Dalgon Alley (except for the two things mentioned above regarding Lucius), the missed train and the car rescues and the weeping willow, Gilderoy Lockhart's amusing doings, the wand duel with Draco, the screaming letter, screeching mandrakes, etc. What is ironic to me is that much of the time spent for the above cited unnecessary (though amusing) events could have been better used in elucidating the many puzzling and unexplained rushed aspects of the plot.  How did Ron know Harry had to be rescued from the Dursley's?  How did the car know to rescue Harry twice (from the train station and the spider cave)?   Two unexplained bird rescues too. Why the whomping willow?  What percent of the wizard kids and teachers were full blood wizards?  Was Harry?  How did Harry know to spike the diary at the end to defeat the bad guy?  Maybe I was nodding off, but the entire diary thing passed me over - was rushed and unexplained.  I would also like to know what rules Harry broke that such a big deal was made over at the end.  And I don't see how Harry putting his own sock into the diary would free Dobby, especially since Lucius didn't give the diary to Dobby! Daniel Radcliff's acting was disappointing to me.  Two examples.  In one scene (I forget where) when he was in the background and some characters in the foreground were talking, he had a vacant look and was gazing/thinking someplace else.  Near the end when he said something like `Of course, phoenix's have healing powers,' he sounded so flat, as though he was reading the script. Finally, the `great Harry Potter' didn't seem so great to me.  He seemed clueless and hopeless most of the time.  He had to be rescued by the car, needed Hermione for her spells and diary research, needed the diary to fall into his lap, had to be rescued twice by the birds and cars, and killed the snake without any magic, spells or thoughts, but by an old-fashioned simple sword thrust (And where did the sword come from?  Another mysterious rescue!)! I'll end with these short comments: (1) best actor and scenes, Kenneth Branagh; (2) cutest scene, Hermione showing  disappointment when the exams were cancelled; (3) darkest most ungrateful scene (really), when Dobby and Harry ruined his uncle's important business dinner; (4) scariest moment for little kids - on opening day I was sitting on the aisle.  Across from me I noticed a group of little girls (about 5 years old).  A few rows back was the maid for one of the little girls.  When the snake appeared the girl on the isle quickly shot up and raced to the maid and leapt into her lap.  After the scene was over, she rejoined her friends; and (5) second best scene: Gilderoy, at the very end of the 10- minute end credits.  Stick around. ",0.0

4326,"""What has four eyes but still can't see?""; Sledgehammer-styled redemption over racial injustice and bigotry. Alan Parker directs this fictionalization of a true-life chapter in which determined F.B.I. men took on the Ku Klux Klan in 1964 after three Civil Rights workers disappeared while driving through a small redneck town in Mississippi. Parker puts the squeeze on us right from the start, omitting few horrors, eventually equating a quest for truth and justice to a violent surge of tables-turning vigilantism (as if there was no other way to succeed here). Since the lawmen in Jessup County have blood on their hands, and the black folks are too scared to speak for fear of retaliation by the whites, the F.B.I. choose to play hardball (impersonating hooded Klansman and taking on the sect's weakest members--even threatening to castrate the mayor!). This third-act revolution certainly gets the audience's blood pumping, while Trevor Jones' score sees to it that we're pounded over the head with suspenseful anticipation. But what happened to the Civil Rights Movement within the movie's time-frame? Surely it didn't disintegrate while this investigation went on? Parker scuttles it for the sake of good old melodrama. In the end, his film is just a well-made racial potboiler, though Gene Hackman's work as underling to Special Agent Willem Dafoe is top-notch (it is perhaps one of Hackman's best performances). Supporting cast also strong, and technically the picture is a superior piece of goods, but it won't be anyone's favorite movie. The spectrum here is narrow, and the statistics at the finale, rushed along, have no dramatic impact whatsoever. **1/2 from ****",0.0
8874,"one of the best and funniest zombie movies ever, think coronation street... with zombies; Shaun is an everyday slob who when we first meet him is having a ""serious discussion"" with his girlfriend about their relationship among her two friends and his drunk oaf of a pal. as this film progresses Shaun realizes his downfall with her and must get her back...after the zombies get there of course... what a perfect idea for a horror movie, this is British comedy at it's finest. the beginning of the movie is Shaun's humdrum existence, living with three friends and working at a dead end job. trying to get along with his step dad. Then as his day progresses there are subtle hints that some kind of illness is going around, something deadly indeed. in fact, when Shaun and his pal ""Ed"" first see one of the infected, they just think she's drunk and then impale her... and that's when the horror movie begins and yet it's still so funny. this movie will be forever known as the funniest zombie movie ever made (unless of course you prefer dead alive, which i do not) it makes me think of Coronation Street every time i watch it, that is a messed up Halloween edition. i think no one could have pulled off this movie better than the Brits. if Americans had their way with this, Shaun would be an advertising exec, with a model girlfriend and a hunk best pal, who encounter zombies but in a mainstream commercial way, which i think wouldn't work, in fact, i don't Americans could ever top this kind of film in general, but that's another topic. all in all, this movie will rock your boat and then some.",0.0
50005,"It's a good movie though not the best; (Warning: The last part of the comment contains some plot of the movie. Please don't be surprised.) I went to the movie theater 3 days after the opening show. I have to admit that both the movie company and the theaters have done a good job of advertising the movie. All over Nanjing, Jiangsu, you could see the advertisements with golden color on the walls, TVs, buses and the subways. So even though consumers have been cheated and teased so many times since the first photographic and computer aided graphics centric movie ""Hero"", they all got to know this movie and expect it to end the endless tragedies of Chinese soap movies. On the board of Worker's cinema, a paste said most of time the theater is gonna be filled with crowded people. So I chose to go on Monday. It's much much better because the No.7 room, one of the best of theirs is almost empty. The movie starts exactly at 2:45pm, though I didn't realized at first. Because the volume was so low and I couldn't feel the same music effect which match the price I paid. I have to say, director Zhang Yi Mou is really good at putting all the brightest colors together. The palace is filled with golden yellow, red and bright green. Even the costume of a common eunuch or lady-in-waiting are wearing the most shining clothes; Don't have to mention the Queen(Gong Li) and the King(Yun-Fat Chow). The story goes much alike as one of the most popular drama in 1930s by Cao Yu.In this movie, the Queen was having an affair with his step son, the crown prince, Yuan Xiang, son of the king's ex-wife. The king knew it since the first day they got together. He decided to poison his wife chronically. Yuan Jie(Jay Chow) is son of the queen and just came back from the border. Slowly the queen discovered that she was being poisoned and decide to rebel in September 9, lunar Chong Yang festival of China. The crown prince was also in love with a royal doctor's daughter, Jiang Chan. It turned out that the royal Doctor's wife is exactly the same woman exiled by the King. To revenge, the queen told the truth that crown prince and Jiang Chan are brothers and sisters. Jiang Chan went insane. The rebel army led by Yuan Jie is attacking the palace while the youngest brother killed Yuan Xiang and tried to usurp the throne. The crown prince discovered the secret before and had told their king that Queen was going to rebel. As a result, the rebel army(golden flower troop) was beaten and all killed by strongly armed escort of the royal palace. The heart broken King declared that if prince Yuan Jie surrender and the queen continue to be poisoned, they could be spared. Yuan Jie suicided in front of his mother and the queen went crazy. It's a tragedy. The story is moving and the actors and actresses did great job though their actor's lines are not well designed. All in all, it's a movie worth seeing in a movie theater and you don't have to laugh at the funny modernized talking of the people in ancient costumes.",0.0
66097,"A new Classic movie to remember; I've always loved good kids movies, because good kids movies do more then entertain kids, they entertain the whole family (Not a good idea to bore the parents taking their kids to see a movie to tears with drek). I also have special movies of my own childhood, and I appreciate movies that really push things to the limit of what should be appropriate for children to see, old classics such as 'Return to Oz', 'A Mouse and Child', and 'Monster Squad' to name a few. This movie really seems to fit along those lines. It's not a simply happy tale like you might expect a kids movie to be, this movie has bite too it, hence the PG rating rather then a tame G rating. This movie also has some of the best work done on it I've seen in a while. I've seen stop motion before, even the latest one which I believe was the Corpse Bride. But this one was so well done, there were many parts of the movie, the majority of it, that was so well done, I could not tell it was stop motion. It looked far too good, more along the lines of CG films like Wall-e and Shrek. That takes skill and time and effort you never see in movies anymore, where making a quick buck is not the exception, but the rule. The story is simple at first, a girl moves to a new home, an old house that has been converted into a 3 level apartment, and is struggling to deal with her parents, who are hard pressed with their work and too busy or tired to deal with the attention demanding girl. She is forced to deal with her neighbors, a crazy and eccentric circus performer and two retired bickering actresses for neighbors, a black cat that gives her the creeps, and a typical loudmouthed and rambunctious boy named Wybie, short for Whyborn. He annoys Coraline (mostly because he is a boy and also because of the fact that he was raised out in the boonies, he has few social graces) but gives her a doll he found in his home, which for some reason is identical to Coraline. Not long after Coraline stumbles onto a strange small door in the gathering room of their flat, but finds the door is not only locked but leads to a brick wall. Its not until that night that Coraline follows a mouse (Her eccentric circus neighbor claims to train dancing mice in his home) to the door, but finds it now leads down a dark tunnel, which leads to a mirror image of her own home, only its populated by strange versions of everyone in her world. Mostly she finds it a dream come true, her 'Other' mother and father, everything Coraline wishes her real parents were, doting on her with gifts and attention, meanwhile her neighbors are transformed into successful versions of themselves and perform for Coraline's amusement. The only other difference is that everything and everyone in this other world has buttons for eyes, and as Coraline visits this place every night, she is offered the chance to stay and be happyÂ… if she replaces her own eyes with buttons I honestly think this movie should be something every child should see. It has moments in it that are so dark and twisted it reminded me of such things as the Silent Hill games, so I'd say make sure your kid does not scare easily. But then again kids need something to scare the snot outta them once in a while, it builds character. Too many things now are pacified, defanged and declawed, left harmless. This movie is sweet and endearing, but can also make you writhe in your seat and even jump from it at times (the 3D does tend to help with this). Honestly I have to say that this movie spooked me out a lot more then any horror movie I've seen in recent memory. It's use of subtle changes and twisting images that we would normally find comforting and safe to be concerning and insecure. I'm immediately reminded of such films as Return to Oz where everything we remembered from the first movie was rendered stagnant, dangerous, and decrepit, leaving you to feel very unsafe in a familiar yet horribly unfamiliar environment. Hopefully, we will see more films like this, and maybe more film makers will be willing to put a bit more effort into their works, focusing on creating classics rather then market success. As for this film, I would recommend it to everyone. Give your kids a good scare, they could probably use one, as it builds character. If you are concerned about scaring your kids too badly, then make it a point to not admit your kids unless they are around 8 or 7. This story definitely reminds me of the older stories children were once told to scare them to sleep or keep them in line, though this one is far more entertaining.",0.0
6537,"Best Summer Sci-Fi Action Film of 2003!; Whoa! That was some fun... 7.5/10 I must say that after being rather disappointed after watching the much anticipated Matrix and X Men sequels in May-June this year, July could as well be the best movie month with the welcoming of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. I did like T1 and T2, but didn't expect much from T3. Surpisingly, it was awesome! Arnold was his same old, Kristanna Loken here was a better ""bad"" terminator than Robert Patrick in T2:Judgement Day, Nick Stahl did great job as a 20+  John Connor and Claire Daines, her humble self as usual, did a dignified supporting role as well. Good starcast, good action, smooth flow of the movie, ocassional wisecracks and ""not overdone yet superb"" special affects make this movie definitely enjoyable. I was honored to see a sneak preview tonight, and indeed it was an honor. Everyone who came out of the 2 theater halls seemed content and satisfied with the third installment of Terminator. Mistow definitely did a good direction and James Cameron wasn't all that missed. Whew! what a break from pseudo-martial arts.

527,"The greatest achievement in filming history; Arguably one of the greatest films ever made, Schindler's List details the struggles of two men who are trying to save as many people as they can during the Holocaust of World War II. Our main character, Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a German business man who runs a company which builds supplies for the German Army. Oskar employs many Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto because he can pay them near nothing to do long hours of labor. He treats them good and if one of his workers is harmed by a Nazi officer he writes letters of complaints and demands retribution for the damage. As the movie progress', Oskar meets Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley). Stern helps Schindler to run the company and is constantly hinting a plea for help to his boss. Slowly, Schindler begins to witness the horrors of the Holocaust after witnessing the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto and the slaughter of hundreds of Jews. Soon Schindler is no longer a cold-hearted German who has a schedule for when his goods need to be made but a man seeking to save everyone he can. Schindler's Lsit draws you in with the very first scene and holds you until the last credit rolls of the screen. Filmed entirely in black and white except for the first and last scene, the movie brings forth a n awesome sense of realism and authenticity. The sets are stunning and the effects sued are captivating. The movie also uses some symbolism which is odd for a Spielberg film. The infamous girl in red is the only character in the entire film who appears in color while the rest is black and white. She is put forth to represent to the conversion of Oskar and is used in only two scenes. Liam Neeson is able to captivate the audience with his breathtaking performance. He is cool and quick thinking, a ladies man and a sly talker. He is able to bring forth the desperation of his character by the end of the film of how hurt and damaged his soul is from what he has witnessed. he is able to bring for Oskar like no other with a sense of realism and compassion, he brings forth a man who is trying to save as many people as he can. I had no idea that Ben Kingsley was in this film until reading the cast list after seeing it. He barely ever talks but when he does, his words will bring tears to your eyes. He brings out the suffering of the Jews and how they are truly innocent of everything the Nazi's hold them accountable for. Kingsley continues with this film to be one of the greatest actors in the industry. The last of the main characters is Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), a troubled German officer and sort of commandant of the concentration camp that Oskar's workers come from. Fiennes kick started his career with this role. Acting opposite of Neeson, he is able to hold his own and bring out the lunacy of what the German's planned to do. You can't help feeling pity for him but also an overwhelming sense of hatred at the same time. It is Fiennes finest role to date. Schindler's List is one of a very few select films that are able to convey a sense of humanity. It shows that murder and genocide solve nothing and that the greatest power to posses is to be able to have power but spare an enemy. The film moved me in a way that I have never felt before, this film will truly stun you. 5 out of 5 Stars",0.0

The relationship between Sully and Mike is right on target, and the storyline is excellent. I did not see this for the humor, but for the plot and setting, and at these the movie is superlative.

But there are also times when the madness comes through in a character, so that you are reminded of some more known works of Scorsese, mainly in the case of the Harvey Keitel character Ben, who really is an as scary boyfriend as you could imagine. Ellen Burstyn is amazing in the role of main character Alice, she is a strong woman who has problems with about every man she meets, but never loses faith in a better future and takes care for her son.

Some times an original angle can be indeed refreshing. Thanks goodness we have no receipt to making movies like the Hollywood one. But still, this here is not the case. It's artsy, it is strange and convoluted, but in the end there is no message to this movie.I left it with nothing, no uplifting feeling, no new take on life's events, nothing. Just a feeling of emptiness. If that's the intended message, than great movie. In fact, I think I just saw a French animated take on Bloodsport.

Absolutely beautiful Northeastern setting, with excellent enough pacing to keep you entertained the entire way through. The boys are surprisingly less dorky than you'd think.

6537,"arnie sure has gotten old...; arnie sure has gotten old, hasn't he? in one way that's cool, but in another it just isn't, cause he doesn't look tough and evil anymore. i liked him very much in his last movie. and i have to say, that i like it. the way he is today he kinda looks cute, more teddybear like i mean. makes me kinda wanna kuddle with him... and that is almost the whole problem with terminator 3. he just isn't the terminator anymore, i think. he's cool with his sunglasses and his character has cool and funny lines in the movie like in the early ones, but it just isn't the same anymore. i also heard the stories about the film before i went to the cinema, that people told, like eddie furlong isn't doing the part of john anymore and it isn't a john cameron movie... and  stuff like that... but after i've seen it i realized that there are much bigger problems with the story and the whole invention of this movie: first thing is that even if i first thought i would miss edward furlong, i just wasn't nick stahl is cool, cause (like many people wrote before) he just IS the son of kyle reese... second comes the much bigger problem... the irresponsible decision of the writers, that sarah connor died of cancer... how much more obvious could you write a person out of the story, regardless what reasons there are, it's just ridiculous how they replaced one female counterpart of john with another, namely (although i liked the perfomance of claire danes quite much) third thing and for me the quite dissapointingst one is the lenght of the movie. i don't think that the movie would have been good under 125 minutes... the introduction of the characters and the story itself is good, but in absolutely no relation to the rest (the action- climax and showdownparts). i couldn't demand the length of the terminator 2 ultimate edition (although it wouldn't have been that bad) but at the end there isn't much story in this whole movie. i think it just isn't complex enough, and that is what i just can't understand... i mean james cameron can do dense, exciting and in no scene boring movies with much story and a length of almost 3h. and he did it a lot of times. (aliens, titanic, terminator 2) and i would think that he kinda thinks of terminator as one of the works of his lifetime, but why does he do such a thing with the terminator movies then? it's just sad... i liked the movie, but i think he just doesn't really like his terminator very much...",0.0
8874,"The funniest zombie movie I've seen so far...; If you have already watched director George Romero's Living Dead films, you can expect a real kick out of one like this! But here's the catch; the story is about a lazy man named Shaun and his companion Ed of whom both share a place together with their college mate, Pete. Funny enough, Shaun is so ignorant to realize the zombie population that is increasing over the town. When he finds a zombie lady in his garden, his first thought is ""She's so drunk!"" And what would a good friend like Ed do while Shaun is being attacked by the lady? Well going back into the house to get a camera of course!

3751,"Chicken Fun; 'Chicken Run' is a delighted little film about...well, chickens. I've always loved the claymation of Aardman. 'Creature Comforts' and 'Wallace and Gromit' are among many of my favorites. Aardman Studios have come up with a brilliant cast, a funny and smart script, fine cinematography and production design. The inspiration of films like 'The Great Escape' shows. The female characters are so strong and yet they have their own sense of humour and Brit-wit. Aardman's claymation is splendid. The large eyes, body size and shape and movements create this a unique class of comedy. The writing is very sharp and crisp but I disliked the obvious symbolism (of British and America joining hands to save the world and fight evil) which looked a little forced. I don't see the need to make the Rocky character an American rooster (as if it's an ingredient to have an American on board). Yet, that does not take away the sheer pleasure and entertainment one derives from the film. The voice cast is suitably chosen. Gibson plays the typical hero with charisma but it's the Brit cast, which includes names like Imelda Staunton, Lynn Ferguson, Jane Horrocks and Julia Sawalha that did it for me. Their sharp witty humour and strong will just put them on a league of their own. 'Chicken Run' is a cute, heartwarming, uplifting and hilarious little film. To quote another user, it is eggcellent!",0.875
6537,"Good casting choices; Terminator 3 was a very enjoyable movie due to both a good story and good casting choices to surround Arnold.  Kristanna Lokan is the standout of the movie as the ultra-sexy and menacing Terminatrix (TX).  She has terrific screen presence and makes for a cold and relentless villain, on par with Robert Patrick's terrific turn as the T-1000 in T2. Here's hoping Lokan gets more good roles in the future.  Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both do well in the pivotal  parts of John Conner and Katie Brewster.  The relationship between these two characters is central to the film and Danes and Stahl showed good chemistry together. The story I thought was very good with an interesting blend of humor with a grim storyline.  It worked, though.  The movie manages to tell a good story without being too pretentious or taking itself too seriously.  The ending was certainly an eyebrow raiser and certainly distinguishes it from the other two Terminator films. One complaint I have was the lack of the Terminator theme music in the movie(until the end credits, anyway).  But other than that, I thought the movie did what it set out to do- tell an interesting story while entertaining the audience. 10/10",0.0
48385,"Borat magnifies the ridiculous and yet allows everyone to root for the ignorant anti-hero who only wants to have a ""sexy time""; You can tell a lot about a person by the way they react to this movie. At the surface, Borat is a really funny movie about a Kazakhstani TV personality who goes on a cross-country trip in the ""US and A"" (as he would like to say) and ends up going on a wild goose chase in search of Pamela Anderson. Get ready for lots of inappropriate, irreverent and shocking, crude behavior! But on another level, the brilliance of Borat is his ability to epitomize the very kind of people he is making a parody of. The movie speaks to everyone because we all have prejudices, just in different degrees of tolerance. As Borat continues to meet all kinds of characters in his trip, the audience learns a lot more about the people Borat meets, and secretly, about themselves if they venture enough to put themselves in the characters' shoes. Now that sounds like too much work for a cheesy documentary/satire, but that's how the movie appeals to a broad range of people on so many levels. One can take this movie and pass it off as crass, toilet humor, and yet one can also take the humor to be quite high-brow in kitschy packaging.

4326,"Powerful and insightful; Mississippi Burning concerns the story of three civil rights activists that disappear one night without a trace in Mississippi. Two detectives are assigned to the case, amidst a backdrop of racial hatred and deceit. No one is willing to talk about what really happened that night on the lonely stretch of road. This movie is a must see, It portrays the south as it was in 1964 with great accuracy and honesty. Films like this need to be made, warts and all, that depict the racial ugliness of the time. Some people argue that stories like this should be sanitized, because they are too politically incorrect. I disagree, for this is how history was, and it needs to be shown in an accurate light, no matter how hard it is to watch. The two leads are great, particularly Willem Dafoe, as detective Ward who is determined that justice will be served, whether the crime victim is white or black. I found this movie to be honest and insightful, telling history as it really was. If you are looking for an entertaining and educational movie, I can recommend Mississippi Burning. Nine stars!",0.0

8874,"Best Horror film of the year. Funny too.; Some may dissmiss this because it looks a bit like a TV program. Some may not ""get"" the humour. Some will be dissapointed it lacks explosions and car chase's. Those people are shallow fools, the people that watch everything hollywood spews out then rush's out to buy the EA game of it. This is the Eternal Darkness of horror. The obscure game/film that is so fresh and new that most people skip right over it. It will quickly become a cult though. Zombies are scary in this, they are dumb, slow, and can be killed easily. Yet they are scary. Far more scary then the runnning jumping leaping ones from 28 Days later. And far scarier then ""Dawn of the Dead"". (this, incidently, is more close to the original film...) This is true horror, and true comady. Strangly they mix perfectly.

5214,"Today's TV movies, yesterday's big-screen box-office smashes.; Back in the late 1970's as ""the blockbuster"" was just building up steam with several disaster films, sci-fi special effects epics and the occasional historical epic, bigger wasn't always better, and in the case of ""Oh, God"", an adorable aging comic had one of the biggest hits of his long career. Oh, and throw in a country/western singer who only made a few movie appearances, and you have the sleeper of 1977, a comic gem that takes punches almost prophetically at evangelists who only a decade later would take public whacks in real life. John Denver is Jerry Mathers, a humble grocery store assistant manager in Tarzana, California who isn't much of a believer in spiritual matters and happens to be chosen by the big G. himself to go out and spread the word that he still exists, is watching over us, and has given us everything we need to make our world work, warning us not to destroy it. 35 years later, this film is still timely, even if certain elements of the details of the script fit 70's mentalities. (Why a remake with Betty White hasn't been done is beyond me!) At first, you only hear the raspy-voiced God until Jerry politely demands to see him, having frustrated his quirky wife Teri Garr with discussions of their first meeting. But when George Burns finally appears in flannel shirt and baseball cap, you know you're dealing with a God out to prove that vaudeville isn't dead, only captured in heavenly terms. Dealing with district manager David Ogden Steirs (of ""MASH"" TV fame) and C.E.O. William Daniels (""1776's"" John Addams) in his professional life, Denver is warned that these visits with God are endangering his career. But God has another job for Denver, and that involves a money-hungry evangelist, brilliantly played by Paul Sorvino with such arrogant cockiness that you long to see him knocked down a peg or two and have him scream to his pulpit, ""I have sinned!"", like a few others would within the next decade. Cameos by such famous faces as Ralph Bellamy, Barnard Hughes and Donald Pleasance round out Larry Gelbart's brilliant screenplay, apparently adapted by director Carl Reiner on its first draft, and deservedly receiving an Oscar Nomination. The film covers some major issues still important to day. God comments on cereals and all of the chemicals that are turning kids into garbage cans. He comments on ""The Exorcist"" and how people could believe the devil on earth, but not him. He discusses Jesus as his son, the ultimate vessel for communication with him, and when sworn in to testify tells judge Hughes with his hands on the bible, ""So help me me."" God also reveals here through Reiner's simply stated screenplay that it only takes one man to create a storm of spirituality, and with this, we also see the religious freaks that utilize organized religion for their own agendas and even sexual fantasies. The performances are direct, to the point, and totally honest, and to top it off, there is a wonderful cameo by then popular afternoon TV hostess Dinah Shore, long before the Oprah's, Jerry Springers and Sally Jesse Raphael's. Having seen this film many years ago when it was first released, I felt its simple message touching my soul, and almost forty years later, it still remains pertinent. At times, the screenplay does have a child-like quality to it, but that is important, because this is a film for all ages and generations to see and pick out individually how it touches them. Believer or not, you can't help but see the possibilities, and in today's ultra-cynical world (10 times more than the mid-late 1970's) consumed with robot-creating technology, this is truly a faith restorer.",0.0
1246,One of the best movies ever!; This movie is one of the very few which express the notion of life in an excellent way. When do the greatest personal developments and changes in life occur? It is the period of time being a young adult. Therefore the mere topic is of extremely interest. The movie deals with this topic in a very impressive way. It was a glowing spot in my life as teenager. Going to school can be tough. And this is not restricted to a conservative boarding school in the 50s. Literature can be boring if you are not interested in it (or if you have not seen this movie). Why poetry? Because we are food for the worms? What does that mean!? What is passion? What is rebellion? What is life? This movie contains some striking examples to these questions.,0.0

6537,"Yes naysayers, it IS better than T2!!!; They said it couldn't be done. No James Cameron. No Linda Hamilton. No Edward Furlong. Arnold well past his prime, both physically, and as a box-office powerhouse. All the early buzz indicated a disaster. But I knew, I felt it in my bones, that this film would be great. Why? Because too many people said it couldn't be done. It's always the way it works. When hype builds a movie up, and everyone is expecting too much (ala Matrix Reloaded), everyone is bound for a letdown. When all hope seems lost, and everyone's expectations are at their lowest, are we then surprised. So thank you all you T3 bashers, you have made me look like prophet! Terminator 3 is not only the best movie so far this summer, it stands head and shoulders above Terminator 2! It actually benefits from Cameron, Hamilton, and Furlong being absent. Camerson has become a Titanic-hugging hacked that peaked years ago. Terminator 1, Aliens, and The Abyss are all masterpieces. He's been on a downhill slide ever since. Sorry Motion Picture Academy, but Titanic sucked the big one. Someone tell me what Linda Hamilton has done besides the Terminator films that is worth watching......I'm waiting.....Thought so. She may have morphed from a whiny waitress, to a female Rambo, but there was nothing else for that character to do. Besides, for all her toughness in T2, she was a much more interesting character in the original. Finally, don't get me started on Edward Furlong. In T2, he was a whiny little bitch that I wished would get killed. He tried to come across as tough, but Furlong is such a bad actor, that he was laughable. T2 also relied too heavily on it's ""ooh"" and ""aahh"" fx. Yes they were spectacular and innovative, but it was too cool to be threatening. Now this is not to say that I didn't like T2. I did. Just not nearly as much as the first. Now comes T3 and the series has been given an incredible kick start. Kudos to the director, Jonathan Mostow. It is my opinion that Mr. Mostow is one of the hottest directors working today. His previous films, Breakdown and U-571, both breathed new life into their respective genres, and T3 is no exception. Mostow does not attempt to be Cameron, and the movie is all the better for it. Mostow brings his own style to the table, and the results are spectacular. The cinematography, editing, and pacing are all top notch. And the action sequences? Incredible! There is a vehicle chase at the beginning of this movie (I hesitate to say ""car chase"" because cars don't really factor into it, unless they are getting demolished) that is awe inspiring. This is what the chase in Matrix Reloaded WANTED to be. It ranks as one of the best chase scenes in movie history. Right up there with The French Connection and The Road Warrior. There is also a brawl between the T-101 and T-X in a public restroom that goes all out. Great stuff. Now what would this movie be without characters? Nick Stahl is PERFECT as John Connor. Now a tortured soul, too torn up by the past to be hopeful of the future, Stahl let's it all hang out. He let's you feel everything Connor does. Hoping for the best, but all the while you feel that fate is going to catch up with you sooner or later. Claire Danes, who I have never been a big fan of, also shines. She is in full Linda Hamilton mode, but better. She is a caring person, but proves that she's tough as nails when the chips are down. Bravo, Ms. Danes. Arnold. What can I say about the man? He may have been away from the character for 10 years, but you'd never know it. Arnold is the Terminator. Now doubts about it. Welcome back Mr. Schwarzenegger, you've been gone too long. Now as for Arnold's nemesis, we have Kristanna Loken as the T-X. Quite simply she, with the exception of Mostow, had the most work cut out for her in this movie. Everyone know what to expect from Arnold. But it is a rule of action movies that they are only as good as their villian. Robert Patrick had the benefit of brand-new CG technology to back him up. While his performance was good, (Especially how he NEVER blinks his eyes while firing a gun. I'd like to see you try that. If you've never noticed, watch T2 and check it out) as I said before, the effects made him more cool than threatening. Now we have Ms. Loken. People scoffed at the idea of a female Terminator to begin with. SO the deck was really stacked against her. Well have no fear, the T-X is here, and she is as bad-ass as they come. Not only can she go toe-to-toe with Arnie, not only can she morph like the T-1000, but she has more than a few tricks up her sleeve. She can reprogram machines, manufature weapons from her arm, and remote control vehicles to really give you a run for your money. She is also one of the most INCREDIBLY beautiul women you will ever see. That adds to her manace, because she has the power of a woman's seductivness on her side, and believe me she uses it. Her beaufiul, icy stare is at once mesmerizing, and terrifying when you realize what is behind those eyes. Way to go Kristanna. Everyone gives their all. The director, actors, and the FX department. But unlike T2, they don't overuse the CG effects. They utilize many styles. GC, miniature work, makeup fx, mechanical effects, and good old-fashioned stunt work. As I said earlier, the chase scene is incredible. Even more so when you realize how much of it was done for real. Simply spectacular. What this movie also has, unlike T2, is the tension of the original film. In T2, you simply dont care about the people. They are only backdrop to the action and fx. Not so here. The makers realized that the characters needed to be as flushed out as the action. That brings the tension level up ten fold. Just like the original. So is it as good as the original? No. But then it couldn't be. So it doesn't try to be. BUT it is a damn great movie, and a big improvement over T2. The best praise I can give it is....BRING ON TERMINATOR 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0.0

Coraline was directed by Henry Selick, who is also the director of The Nightmare Before Christmas, a visual masterpiece from the talented world of Tim Burton. I was very excited to see this because Henry has worked with Tim before, and both of their works are always AMAZING. I loved how they did it in stop motion animation and it was incredible in 3D, very real. This movie is about a young girl named Coraline who is a little bit neglected by her parents. She's a little bit of an outcast, she's her own person. They've just moved into a new house and she gets no attention from her parents. She discovers a small door in her house that takes her to a different world, like a parallel universe. That seems amazing, but of course, nothing's ever what you think.

71057,"""Technology is bad, but buy this on Blu-Ray""; Call me demanding, but I have always believed movies should have well-contrived and meaningful plots, not just half-baked hints and guesses masquerading as one. And that's the main problem with 9. Sure, the visuals are impressive. Sure, the post-apocalyptic environment is depicted frightfully gloomy. Sure, the machines are very scary and stitchpunks' helplessness is really touching (at least during the first 15 minutes). But what is the meaning of all that? Why are the stitchpunks created? What is their purpose? What was the purpose of The Machine? How did it fail its creators? Why is 1 implying ""dark science"" and what exactly does he know about the past? Why the soul-sucking modus operandi? How did The Machine know what the stitchpunks are, if they were created after The Machine? So many questions which the script doesn't even try to answer, although the potential for an interesting story is obviously there. The only point this movie tries to shove in your face is the same, old ""technology is bad"" clichÃ© - watch out for those lovely, tiny green creatures bathing in the raindrops, they will mend the world all right.",0.0
48385,"stupid isn't always funny; I was hoping for something more from this movie, having seen some of Sacha Baron Cohen's other stuff and having heard lots of good things about the film from friends. There were a couple of funny scenes but overall the movie was boring and predictable. It seems stuck in that sort of Tom Green mentality, stupid + offensive = funny. Cohen's shtick is basically that he's supposed to be from one of the former Soviet Republics, and he likes to see how far he can push ""regular"" people (most of whom seem to be actors) before they drop politically correct facades and get angry at him. I think the idea is that he is sort of making everyone else ridiculous, and it's true that there's almost no way to retain your ""cool"" if you were confronted on the street by someone of ""Borat's"" ilk. But any kind of political or personal revelations in the movie are highly suspect. It's funny to watch him exhort a rodeo audience to ""destroy Iraq, kill all living things"" and so forth, but the guy is just so far over the top that it's impossible to believe that anyone really takes him seriously. He needs to play it a bit more straight in my opinion in order for it to be really funny. With the ""frat"" boys, for example, you could see it as Borat conning them all into revealing some of the casual ugliness of their lifestyles. That is, you could see it that way if you were really naive and you didn't think that Borat's act is so outrageous that the guys in the movie were just sort of playing along with the general craziness. In my opinion it's not really worth seeing.",0.0
38038,"Good film for all the family; This is a thumbs up for a film that is as entertaining for the adults as the children. This is a film that operates at a number of levels. For younger viewers it is a great primer for classic horror within a non-threatening, humour filled vehicle. For film buffs there are references by the score. I think that the stop-motion filming gives time for the makers to consider and introduce a plethora of nice touches. Wallace has been putting on weight, as the camera pans across the kitchen table it passes a marmalade jar labelled 'Middle Age Spread'. This attention to detail is evident in nearly every scene, and I am positive further viewing will prove I missed a lot of gags - and I will be re-viewing this film.

71057,"Not very cheerful, but quite good; 9 was an interesting experience for me. I went into it knowing very little about it, and found myself watching a movie where I genuinely had no idea what was going to happen next. The story concerns a number of small fabric-covered robots which appear to be the only living entities in a world ravaged by warfare, apart from a hostile dinosaur-like machine. When 9 comes to consciousness he is responsible for taking his numbered fellows out of their comfort zone into what turns out to be a quest for their origins. This rather quirky story (and I'm a sucker for post-apocalyptic stories to start off with) is visually very striking, set at ground level in a world of ruined devastation and large artefacts (ie. normal sized, but large to these small characters) seen from ground level, some of which are barely recognisable. The idea of having each of these characters made out of fabric (and each with a different type of fastening) is demented but brilliant. The voice talent is also excellent with Elijah Wood and Christopher Plummer being most recognisable among a stellar cast. But beware. This movie doesn't have the heart of a Pixar movie, nor does it have the primary coloured joie de vivre of a CGI feature from one of the other production companies. This rather dark, drab movie, is not aimed at children at all: it is perhaps the first CGI fantasy sci-fi feature aimed at adults and, as such, it succeeds fairly well.",0.0

The movie is not politically correct and pokes fun at every race and social class. You will find yourself laughing loudly when it is your social class for some warped reason. However if you like to laugh uproariously at stupid, crude, humor it is for you. I caught it one day on satellite when I was home alone. It was a movie I thought that I would never ever like from reading other reviews about it. But I was dead wrong. I was entranced by the fast pace and the whole thing got over with way too soon for my liking. I wish there would be a sequel made! I caught myself laughing way too loud since nobody was home to chastise me. It was the type of movie where a lot of stuff seamlessly came together. Some slapstick comedy, goofy badly spoken and accented English, and cultural misunderstandings are the mainstay of the script and they are brilliantly assembled by Cohen. It put me in the mind of the BBC TV show, Little Britain. I may secretly buy myself a DVD copy of this for Christmas.",0.0
903,"A Brilliant Piece of Filmmaking!; Vertigo is by far Hitchcock's masterpiece (some will argue Psycho is, but Vertigo is real technical genius).  Telling the story of an obsessed ex-cop (Stewart), Hitchcock weaves a tangled web of suspense, inner conflict, and the supernatural. Of all Hitchcock's films, this one is said to be the most personal, as it regards Hitch's fascination with women and the traits of actresses. Bernard Herrman's score is one of his bests.  Incorporating a dizzying series of notes in the string section- musically achieving the effect of vertigo.  Later, Herrman brings out his lush, romantic melodies, with beautiful tones, but always with an underlying harmony of doom. Perhaps featuring one of the best scenes in all of film history-Hitch lets his brilliance of camera work, knowledge of Herrman's musical abilities, and the actor's/actress's skill, capture us in a moment in time never to be forgotten. A perfect 10!  It never goes wrong",0.0
1175,"Unique, Stylish and easy to enjoy; Niche, art-house films, like delicatessen, i often find. are hard to enjoy, i find myself searching for hidden creative meanings, pretentious expressionism and obscure references and often sit puzzled as i try to distinguish the fine line between creative genius and random drivel. However Delicatessen is an exception, the array of different shots, angles and narrative techniques allow the viewer to appreciate and enjoy this film on so many levels, one can watch the film for any area of study or interest, be it mise-en-scene lighting or narrative. Jeunet and Caro have mastered every single aspect of cinema in this one film, and because of this, the film is on the one hand a challenging thought provoking film that requires deep concentration, but on the other simply an entertaining flick, i think that Jeunet and Caro have managed to find the perfect equilibrium between entertainment and art. The film seems to give you light hearted entertainment, and then offer you the more expressionistic and art-house elements if you want to notice them. This makes the film unique and slightly refreshing as it is a nice break from other artistic films that seem to sometimes be packed full of expression that it drowns the narrative and makes it impossible for the film to be viewed as entertainment. all in all, Delicatessen encapsulates the creative genius of Jeunet and Caro showing the viewer their true powers of imagination, creativity and ability of expression, whilst still allowing the viewer to enjoy the film and also enjoy it at surface value. A truly great film",0.0
8838,I could not stand that kid.; Alice has a husband and a very annoying little boy. She longs to sing and play the piano. Then her husband dies so she takes off with her son to find work as a lounge singer. She should have left the kid behind because he was so annoying. Every couple of seconds he would jump in with some obnoxious comment. I really liked the songs in this movie and thought that they were beautiful. It's also a female power movie because Alice goes out into the world as a widowed/single mother with a son. She ends up working in a diner and trying to raise this kid. She finds love but she loves her son more. I don't know how she could stand him. I didn't know Jodie Foster was in it until I read it here. That was a surprise. It's a great movie minus her son.,0.0

4326,"Changing Times; KTLA, Los Angeles, showed last night this movie in which some of the more horrific scenes are even more difficult to watch because we know that they were not the figment of some writer's imagination, but they were true events which actually happened no so long ago. It really is Cinema Verite' at its very best. I have watched regularly the original broadcast of the TV series"" In the Heat of the Night"" where Carrol O'Connor is a white Sheriff/Police Chief in a small fictitious Mississippi town, and his African-American Detective is played by Howard E. Rollins. The inter- action between those two characters and the realistic way they are dealt with ,makes it a real pleasure to watch. Its episodes describe  very plausible situations which occurred not long after the events shown in Mississippi Burning , and this country must be proud of the great changes which have taken place in such a short period of time. We are living in a historic transitional period when social changes are happening very fast, and at a speed that nobody thought could be possible.",0.0
527,"A Nice Nazi?  You Must Be Joking!; This is a great movie. It is a story that had to be told. As unbelievable as it is, even a Nazi was capable of showing compassion, of pausing to stop and explore his own conscience and make decisions that saved people from death. This Nazi had every incentive to dispose of his charges yet decides not to it and instead takes the high road with dramatic results. Counterposed to him was another Nazi who wantonly murdered people and in the paid for that with his life. Yes, two Nazis, one guided by the highest principles, the other who was devoid of even the slightest spark of kindness, both Germans, yet both different. Why? Who knows? I know that everyone raved about this movie and how it was Spielberg's greatest and most important movie. Well, guess what: I don't need Hollywood giving me a history lesson on the Holocaust or trying to capitalize on the suffering the victims of that event had to endure. I don't need a Hollywood producer or director trying to manipulate into thinking that some Nazi really had second-thoughts about the plight of the Jews ... many of whom happened to be German too. If you want to watch a really good movie about where the German people were at when it came to Nazism, watch the ""Mortal Storm"" made in 1940, or watch any of Leni Reifenstahl's documentaries glorifying the Nazi system. These movies were made when the Nazis were actually in power. But don't tell me decades after the war that there were Nazis with a conscience because if that had been the case, Adolf Hitler would not have lasted one day in office. Hitler could not have done what he did if he did not have the unanimous approval of EVERY Nazi who followed his lead. A Nazi who cared? Yeah ... right. The next thing Hollywood will be telling us is the Genghis Khan wasn't such a bad guy or that Isaac the Terrible wasn't all that terrible, just misunderstood and blah, blah blah. If Hollywood thinks the story ... any story ... will make money, they'll try to exploit it for all its worth. Now, what I really want to know, however, is why was the movie filmed in black-and-white? Were concentration camps painted in black-and-white paint? Were the inmates black-and-white? Or the guards? I don't think so. And that concentration-camp commandant who's taking pot-shots at the inmates? Was that supposed to tell us that the Nazis were depraved wanton murderers? Once again, I don't need this movie to tell me that. I know that. Plus that subject was fully covered in ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" which did a much better job of it, minus all the gratuitous violence. So if you want to watch a black-and-white movie about a Nazi, who, for reasons never explained, decides to protect Jews and also shows Jews being subjected to all forms of mistreatment and violence and terror, then this is the movie for you. But for goodness sake, don't construe this movie as being a history lesson because if you do, you'll come away believing that some Nazis were actually nice, and there's no way I'll ever believe that.",0.0

4388,"not scary, not funny, not even so bad its funny - but worse!; most of the reviews I've written so far have been glowing or at least grudgingly good with a few criticisms. This is the first I've written where I can find no redeeming qualities about it. So why 2 stars? Well, it is only 79 minutes long, and Anna Faris is reasonably pretty. Thats about it though, and really the only reason it didn't get lower is because i simply don't like giving 1 out of 10 simply because of the work that goes into making any film - but this film comes closer than almost any other I've seen. Whereas the first Scary Movie, whilst not exactly brilliant, was a relatively original spoof of Scream and I know what you did last summer, with some genuinely funny moments, Scary Movie 2 has none of these. Furthermore, the first film stuck to poking fun at horror films, whereas this abomination of a sequel frequently meandered off aimlessly into other films, most notably a Charlie's Angels sequence. With the exception of the Wayans Brothers and Faris, the majority of the 'names' from the first film are absent - not that their presence could have salvaged this road accident of a film. What on earth were Tim Curry and James Woods thinking? The jokes are purile and immature, and their crude nature make the humour from the first film look like an Oscar Wilde play. Surely there are only so many times projectile vomiting and bodily functions can be amusing? and surely they are before the age of 15? (incidentally, this film is an 18, but it surely cannot have been aimed at over-18s). The film starts only reasonably bad with a spoof of the exorcist, and, whilst never approaching the comedy of the first (that in itself not a great challenge to meet), it is watchable. Its all downhill from there though. As spoofs go, Spaceballs it ain't. By the end you are simply crying out for whatever serial killer they are spoofing at present to slash up them or, failing that, you. The tag-line read more laughs, more screams, less clothes - inaccurate on all three counts. I've never given a film such a slating before, so this is a novel experience for me, and oddly a rather calming one too. The only scare to come out of this film is the prospect of a third film, and even a rumoured fourth in the franchise in the works. A truly terrifying prospect indeed.",0.0
1148,"A true mile stone of animation; Nick Park's hysterical plasticine duo Wallace and Gromit are back in this, their second outing, pitting themselves against the plotting penguine whose devious nature is taking advantage of Wallace's niavity.  However, the ever suspicious Gromit is seeing through the Penguine's frosty exterior and sets out to uncover his secret scheming shadowy plan. The Wrong Trousers is the best so far from Peter Lord and Nick Park, putting even the outstanding Chicken Run and Close Shave in it's shadow.  The characterisation is simply electrical.  The ever suffering but mute Gromit and the clumsy well meaning Wallace muddle their way to stopping a truely outstanding criminal genius penguine (whose pesona is portrayed with such subtlety and effect that the cute bird becomes the very essence of evil). Park and Lord's pace and cinematography in this animation medium are truely world leading, climaxing in the mad mayhem of a train-set chase through their house. The plot is simple yet full of nuances and details (check out the headline's on Wallace's newspaper and the wall paper in Gromit's bedroom)raising this above even the best that that big studios can produce. A film almost without fault which pays homage to the greatest and most farciscal works of the great Ealing comedy era (there is something sinister happening but, it isn't that sinister really).  Watch this film and let the quality and clarity of the humour seep into your soul. A true mile-stone of animation which deserved it's oscar like no other animation ever will.",1.0

8874,"""I think they really want to get in!""; This movie, is hands down, hilarious. Not only that, its an amazing movie simply because, although it is categorized as a comedy, it cuts across several other genres and collaborates them beautifully. A comedy, a horror/zombie flick, an action movie, a drama, a brit-flick, and finally, believe it or not, a romantic comedy. (yes to everyone in the UK, a lot of us here actually consider a ""brit-flick"" a genre.) To put it this way: my girlfriend, who doesn't like bloody horror flicks, action flicks, or British movies, actually admitted she liked it, after I ""put her through it."" It incorporates all the elements of these categories and knows exactly when to bring out each. I agree with what another poster has said, that it is amazingly ""realistic"" for the kind of movie that it is. Meaning, the characters react to the situations the way normal people do, for the most part. There are no real ""heroes;"" Shaun himself does nothing truly amazing, except for be himself, and try his best to keep his loved ones alive. I could watch this movie again and again, and for me its rare to say that about a comedy.",0.0

903,"Overrated, but still good.; Vertigo is highly touted as one of the greatest works of renowned filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock, and though it is a great film with many merits, there are elements of it which diminish its luster a bit. The rising action of the film is very well constructed, with the mystery of Madeline's behavior revealing itself and then uncoiling in a slow and deliberate way that builds the suspense that one suspects from Hitchcock. The story and intrigue layer and build until the fateful scene in the mission stairwell. The moment of Madeline's ""suicide"" feels very much like the climax of the film, and indeed the film seems about to end when Scottie is placed in a mental care facility (And the film could well have ended there and been quite good.), but it does not. Instead a sort of second story arc begins with Scottie released from the hospital and running across Judy at Ernie's. This discovery leads to a series of ""make over"" scenes in which Scottie attempts to transform Judy back into Madeline. Scotties motivation in these scenes can be a bit hard to place, making this section of the film difficult to follow for some, and can be quite discouraging to less diligent viewers. Those who do have the fortitude or curiosity to endure are treated to a wonderful twist ending that firmly snaps the section of film in question into perspective. The film deals rather unabashedly with the issue of obsession. The main characters in the film are either possessed of or develop strong obsessions that ultimately lead to their undoing: Gavin's desire to kill his wife, Scottie's obsession over Madeline, and, even though it is later revealed to be non- genuine, Madeline's obsession with Carlotta Valdes. A visual aspect of Vertigo that bears mentioning, aside from the now famous ""trombone"" shot, is the use of color in the film to define and separate scenes from one another. Various color palates are used in different locations such as the yellows of Midge's apartment, the red of Ernie's, or the whites of the various mission houses. Overall, a great film worth viewing, but perhaps a bit overrated.",0.0

It wasn't all that bad and I would never say that it was terrible, but I just feel like you could have removed so much, and gotten rid of a few of the filler bits. However, the visuals are still great and the acting is better here. Those are two things that get better with each movie. The visuals are obvious, but the acting is an improvement that is very welcome to make the film good enough to watch even with the boring bits.",0.0
8874,"It's Funny As Long As Someone Gets Hurt; ""Shaun Of The Dead"" has been dubbed a ""zom-rom-com"", meaning a romantic comedy featuring zombies. Yet it really works only in terms of the zombies, and there less on its own merits than in the way it channels famous past films about the undead. It was amusing, at times impressive, but never engaging. Shaun (Simon Pegg) works a London electronics store, his life as dull and pointless as any other in his sad city. His main problem is reconciling his responsibilities with girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) with his other long-term relationship involving layabout buddy Ed (Nick Frost). ""Things will change, I promise,"" Shaun tells Liz. He soon discovers how right he is, after bumping into assorted people with shuffling walks, dead-eyed stares, and a tendency, as Shaun's mother puts it, to get ""a bit bitey"". Written by Pegg and director Edgar Wright, ""Shaun Of The Dead"" is less a send-up than a celebration of the zombie-film culture, playing the comedy less in the manner of a Mel Brooks spoof and more in a way that respects the whole notion of zombies appearing in one's world, attacking loved ones. The laughs come as much from Shaun and Ed's deadpan reactions, and the film's way of teasing the audience with allusions both to other zombie films and to the British television work of the film's stars. That's too many in-jokes for me, not to mention a singular lack of charisma by any of the film's principals. If not as deliberately off-putting as the work of other British comedians like Sasha Cohen and Ricky Gervais, there's a strong whiff of au currant kitchen-sink misery to ""Shaun"" that deadens a lot of the pleasure to be had. Ironically, ""Shaun"" was shot in part at Ealing Studios, making it an Ealing comedy, though of a different kind than Alec Guinness would have known. But that's my cultural take, from someone admittedly not a part of that culture. I'm over 40, and this film was not made for me. Fair enough. Does ""Shaun"" work on its own terms? At times. Mostly, it works as a fairly involving zombie film with real violence and some comic relief. Not as lovable as ""Return Of The Living Dead"" or as clever as ""Evil Dead 2"", it nevertheless keeps things moving and has a good narrative arc all the way to the final big scene, a showdown at Shaun's favorite bar that rivals the Alamo sequence in ""Saving Pvt. Ryan"" for desperate intensity. There, the three principals and their companions must stave off a wave of zombies, and the build-up gives otherwise lame ideas like a pool-cue beatdown in time to Queen's ""Don't Stop Me Now"" a real lift. If only I cared enough about the characters to fret over their horrible fates. Good zombie films manage some emotional remove, and ""Shaun"" does, too, but that works too often at the expense of the ""rom"" and the ""com"". Pegg and Ashfield play well off one another, and there's a fine turn by Bill Nighy as Shaun's unloved father-in-law, but I quickly tired of Ed and found myself at times bemoaning the zombies' slow-footedness. An okay movie that could have been better, ""Shaun"" works at times on its own self-referential terms. But when people weren't getting killed, I wasn't laughing. That's a strange thing to have to say about a comedy.",0.0
903,"Bit Of A Let Down; I was a bit let down by ""Vertigo"". I watched it for the first time just recently and with all the great things I had been hearing about it for years and years, I was expecting something truly monumental. Even if I did not have such high hopes, I don't feel as though I would have been overly impressed, as I feel a ""pretty good"" rating is spot on. It felt to me that everything was just too convenient to drive the story along. I mean, had Scottie not reacted exactly as Gavin and Madeline had anticipated, everything would have unraveled and fallen apart. This story just asks the audience to stretch reality to give them the benefit of the doubt one too many times. Later on, when Scottie finds Judy and falls in love with her again, it all felt so clunky. I'm not sure if he knew all along that it was or was not Madeline, but either way, the chemistry between the two characters left me scratching my head. The end with the nun felt all too random as well. My interpretation is that a thing of good had come to face Judy and Judy could not bear the wrongs she had committed, so she allowed herself to fall. It feels like a cheap ending. They might have just had Scottie wake up and said, ""it was all a dream.""",0.0
48385,"A wonderfully funny film and sad indictment of our society...; I finally saw this film today, after much anticipation and found it to be gut busting funny and frighteningly insightful at the same time. The jokes were raw and the kind that make you laugh out loud hard, however by the same token, this film showed some of the worst sides of human behavior. There is an old saw about what you do when you do not think people are looking is a true indication of your character. In this case, people showed their worst biases and prejudices and knew they were being filmed. I do not want to spoil this for those of you who have not seen the film yet, however Baron Cohen cuts deep into the underbelly of hubris, prejudice and mean spirited thinking that shows how in-human we have become. Thankfully, he leavens these painful scenes with very funny humor and placing people in very bizarre situations that force their true colors to show in a very humorous way. Baron Cohen and his team deserve all the positive recognition they have and will receive from this film, I am hopeful that those who see this movie learn some humanity from the lessons shown in this film. Additional comment: I have been reviewing the comments made by many IMDb members and am not surprised by the polarized views on this film; however, I am surprised at the self-righteous indignation of many reviews.

1246,"Dead Poets Society; ""Dead Poets Society"" Â– A film that makes you think about your dreams and your decisions in life. Good or bad decisions ""Carpe Diem Â– Seize the day."" This statement is made by Mr. Keating, the special and unique teacher of ""Welton Academy"". After he had taught his students the sense of ""Carpe Diem"" and poetry, the way of thinking of many students changed and some of them started to finish what Mr. Keating had begun when he was at the same age. If you are looking for a film to watch it in class, you should have a look at ""Dead Poets Society"". It's a 1986 drama film which is directed by Peter Weir and is set at the ""Welton Academy"" in Vermont. It deals with the teacher Mr Keating who inspires his students with his special view of life and so they build a group called ""Dead Poets Society"". They meet each other at a cave near the school where they talk about poetry to express themselves. The cave scenes are very amusing and show the boys in funny situations during the meetings. The ""new Dead Poets Society"" consists of quite different personalities: Neil Perry, the self-confident founder of the group, the shy Todd Anderson, the noisy Richard Cameron, Steven Meeks, the clever one, Charlie Dalton and last but not least Knox Overstreet, a very friendly and polite student. You may find it easy to identify with one of the young boys because of the interesting characters. They can surprise you in different ways and can also make you laugh. If I was asked to rate this film on a scale from 0 Â– 10, I would give it 7 points as the film is easy to understand and all elements, which make life worth it like love, friendship or disagreement, are included.

Even if the first part of the film wasn't already excellent, you have Scottie(James Stewart) transforming Judy Barton(Kim Novak) into Madeleine, and his near descent into madness(?). No one but Hitchocock could do it as good as this. An interesting thing to note, is that it was based on a French book by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac called ""D'Entre Les Morts"".

Dakota Fanning voices the young Coraline and brings spunk and personality to a young heroin. Teri Hatcher in the villainous role of Coraline's alternate mother is simply marvelous. A terrific voice-acting performance and not since Ellen Degeneres have we seen an actress so involved. The rest of the usual suspects are there, Jennifer Saunders, Keith David, and Ian McShane. The story is very well told and in my humble opinion, not suitable at all for children. This is a lot even for me.

1246,"Teach them the passion of learning,not the learning of passion ...; The first time I saw ""Dead Poets Society"" at 16, I liked it Â… BUT Â… my appreciation was undermined by the fact that many high school teachers were screening this and ""Good Will Hunting"" to us. I guess their pedagogic value didn't leave them indifferent, nor the inspirational message about learning to think by ourselves, and to forge well-made rather than well-filled heads. Now I'm almost thirty, I saw the film several times, I read Roger Ebert's infamous review, I went to prep school, then a prestigious business school, I had my share of dreams and conflicts with my father, enough to build a second and more constructive opinion. On the surface, ""Dead Poets Society"" ticks all the boxes of the great film begging for a Best Picture nomination, the impressive direction, the dazzling cinematography, the inspirational score, the sober setting, the supporting characters implying numerous subplots enriching the story and on the top of that: the inspirational message lying beneath an endearing script, full of poetry and an intelligent hymn to the extraordinary value of life. ""Dead Poets Society"" is a remarkable cinematic achievement Â… BUT Â… isn't life too complex a concept to be only defined by the duality of oppression/repression, conservatism/freedom. Are we either free- spirited or close-minded? Peter Weir can't prevent the script from falling into inexcusably manipulative clichÃ©s. The movie sins by oversimplification, when it could have developed a more human and realistic approach instead of the whole hysteria that invokes romantic poetry as a dream builder. On that level, I've always had a problem with Neil's suicide. I couldn't put my finger why, until I had an important discussion with my father. I revealed that everything I did was out of fear of disappointing him. He invested a lot of hopes for my future, but in the end, I was unhappy, and wished I could fulfill my personal, artistic dreams. I will never forget his answer. It was my entire fault, and I was just so lazy I couldn't do something on my own. I waited for a support when I could at least give a try and present him with a fait accompli. He was right, all I did was comforting my thinking with the fallacious idea that I would never make my dreams true as long as he disapproved. Parents are notorious for being the first dream-killers, but believing it's an insurmountable obstacle is the sign of a level of immaturity so high, that any anti-conformism would fatally lead to irresponsible decisions anyway. Neil had choices. By leaving the house, he would have tried to live by himself, to become an adult. Through an existential impulse, as the most authentic illustration of the 'Carpe Diem' motto, instead of killing himself; he would have symbolically killed his father, and become a man Â… OR Â…he could have considered the possibility to study theater in Harvard. Neil acted out of cowardice, starting by a lie that would have naturally upset his domineering father. Besides, how was Mr. Perry supposed to react after seeing his son in a ridiculous costume expectable from a first-grade school play, it wasn't even Shakespeare or some Roman tragedyÂ… the suicide killed the very purpose of the film, by trying to point an accusing finger on an oppressive system, responsible of Neil's act while the mise en scene was so overdone that it failed to show it as an act of despair. This Manichean approach falls in lamentably formulaic plot devices, in order to make Keating the scapegoat of a fascist system, while Neil is the only one to blame. Or, for that matter, the writer, who probably thought that 'death' is so cinematically impacting, it's the only way to solve a problem, while it's pure opportunistic dramatization. Anyway, Neil was the leader of the group : with his death, all the wannabe-poets were reduced to a bunch of recycled stereotypes, illustrating the worst influence an anti- establishment mind can have on spoiled rich kids with the right predispositions for pseudo rebellion. The most outrageous, yet realistic one is the use of poetry to impress and seduce girls. At least, one was sincere in his Don Juan role, while the other could have been more responsible and respect the fact that the girl he wanted was with another boy. Anyway, the romantic subplot was dull and predictable and reduced poetry to a bunch of slogans made up to 'get the girl'. I had a guy in high school who published poems dedicated to some classmates (all girls naturally) and they were all meowing over how sweet it was. As a poem writer myself, I couldn't help but question the motivation behind these writings. (I won't go further with the other characters, one was labeled as the official villain, with no redeeming quality, and the two nerdy guys played the comic relief par, I liked it when they danced rock'n'roll but who the hell were these two guys fencing outside ?) Poetry as seduction or poetry as therapy to overcome a sickly shyness, in the content, the whole course of Mr. Keating is a show, where the students love more the teacher than poetry. In prep school, I will never forget my math teacher who was a tyrant, she made me so nervous I felt I would nauseate sometimes. But ultimately, I remember her as one of the greatest teachers I ever had. ""Dead Poets Society"" starts with the wrong step by showing a professor already popular, when the greatest achievement is to go against the naturally pointless rebellious attitude of student. Teach them the passion for learning not the learning of passion. Besides, some of the greatest artistic Âœuvres were made during oppressive times, that let the very best of human soul translate its angst, its passion in an explosion of creativity ... and one must experience prison to dream of escape.",0.0

19,"When Nature Calls, Avoid This Film.; Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995): Dir: Steve Oedekerk / Cast: Jim Carrey, Ian McNeice, Simon Callow, Sophie Okonodo, Bob Gunton: Dumb comedy about the union between man and animals and the stand to preserve wildlife. It opens with a parody of Cliffhanger where Ace Ventura fails to save a raccoon stranded on a mountainside. Depressed, he secludes himself in a temple until he is summoned to Africa to find the sacred bat thus preventing a war between two tribes. Basically the same stupid concept as Ace Ventura: Pet Detective that devises predictable developments and recycled dialogue. The tribal jokes are offensive but director Steve Oedekerk allows for beautiful shots of Africa that are pretty much the best aspect of the film. In fact, watching ninety minutes of African footage on your average wildlife program would be better time spent than watching this. Jim Carrey does nothing new accept portray Ace as a bigger jackass. Ian McNeice is wasted as Ace's contact. Simon Callow plays the villain whose final scene has him molested by a gorilla. Sophie Okonodo plays the tribal Princess who encounters Ventura and allows him to pop her cherry before her wedding. This has him chased away from the village in a manner that many critics of this film may of felt. Serves only as a lame sequel and with all its idiotic mayhem it's a wonder why anyone would want to hear nature call. Score: 3 / 10",0.0
903,"Amazing Masterpiece; Hitchcock's Vertigo is stunning. This film is a textbook that the tutor taught us on the directing course. To be honest, I didn't know much about films before completing my film production degree, but Hitchcock's works are the cornerstone for me to explore the deeper meaning of all aspects. From the narrative perspective, the suspense built up in such a natural but thrilling way, the twist in the middle is brilliant. From the visual standpoint, a creative feature is a colour representing a particular meaning, the more times I watch, the more I appreciate this brilliant masterpiece. It's worth learning.",0.0
903,"Vertigo; About two months ago, when Sight & Sound magazine announced their critics polls of my film of all time (a referendum carried out every decade), VERTIGO has unanticipatedly usurped CITIZEN KANE's seemingly invincible titleholder, which as a matter of course, has ensured many discordant responses, so it seems to be a perfect time to watch Hitchcock's (at least currently) crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me. I eschewed any possible spoilers before embarking on the film (a BluRay set of 1996 restored version), it has been fully testified (regardless of the faintly drawn-out stalking sequences, great framing nevertheless) that a stirring frisson is duly on the course of solving the absorbing doppelgÃ¤nger riddle. Visually there are some ground-breaking craftsmanship in the film, from the opening eye- focusing montages to the recurrent vertigo motif, even an abrupt cartoon snippet during the hair-raising nightmare scenes (which I estimate should be credited to the restore department). But the magnetic gravitation is the enigmatic pleasure from the perspective of a mutual love affair between a well-clad former detective and an equally enigmatic married woman (not the generic femme fatale brand though) whose motivation has been tainted since the very beginning. So in spite of that the set-up is almost immaculately deployed (until a rather second-rate glitch to culminate the finale), but one thing might not be so popular as it was half a century ago, the shifting role of female in the society, Kim Novak's character's vulnerability and fatalism infatuation just doesn't feel sound enough to elevate the plot onto the final peak. Partially it is also the performers' problem, Novak's glacial distance cannot pull herself through as a deft actor (neither for the scheme nor for the film), so it descends to a mere sexual impulse from James Stewart's standpoint, which I don't suppose is Hitchcock's idea. Also Stewart's paranoid ""minute copy"" compulsion does mar some empathy toward him. The film at bottom is a two-hander, so Barbara Bel Geddes and Tom Helmore are the only supporting roles which are all underdeveloped, particularly, Bel Geddes' s one-sided affection has a buoyant start but completely sidelined after her inappropriate painting incident, leaving an unusual loose end. So the film has its old-fashioned value of love and done an acute anatomy of the hallucinatory symptoms when one falls for a feigned personality (the torture is bilateral), but calls it ""the best film ever"" is a way too grave grandstanding which does no good to any films at all (even CITIZEN KANE has to pay its price), but I daresay 10 years later, VERTIGO will add another title under its belt, ""a one-time champion of the best film of all time"".",0.0
527,"Spielberg's cinema is simply great!; It's September, 1939. Oskar Schindler is a Nazi-Catholic industrialist from Czechoslovakia, a bon-vivant who realizes that a nice long war in Europe might be an excellent situation for making money... So in a great opening parallel montage, Spielberg depicts the personal journey of one man and the massive journey of one race... As thousand of families are forced to abandon their careers, properties and homes to live in overcrowded ghettos, the scene switches to Schindler, where he pays his way to get a fine table at a fancy nightclub in Nazi-occupied city of Krakow, the surviving gem of Poland's medieval cities... Drinking alone, he scans the strange clientele and slowly sets about casting his nets on the SS German officers... He quickly plied them with food, caviar and French wine... And as a magician, overcoming every resistance, he transforms the separate tables of the cabaret into one joyful drunken party of wine, women, and song for the Nazi officials... The two worlds come together when Schindler meets Itzhak Stern and offers him a deal... Since Jews cannot own businesses, they should work together... Stern's contacts can provide investors, and Stern's expertise can run the business, and Schindler will take care of the presentation... In those same scenes, Amon Goeth is introduced... Goeth is a flabby psychopath who comes to embody the evils of Nazi racism... He is in charge of the camp where the workers are housed and must be bribed and pampered if Schindler is to stay in business... Goeth's excessive cruelty is also part of the reason that Schindler is transformed from an opportunistic 'victimizer' to 'humanitarian.' Liam Neeson portrays Oskar Schindler, the businessman with irresistible charm - the charm of the same magnitude that saved hundreds of innocent people and brightened Schindler's reputation among critical historians... As movie gradually progresses, Schindler's perspective changes much as when he himself states that ""People die - it's a fact of life."" Neeson's flexibility as an actor is impressive... His performance is built on a combination of self-confidence, indecision, and doubt... His character is always evolving, yet always convincing... His transformation from 'war profiteer' to a ""righteous"" man is adequately slow and well developed... As the war draws to a close, Schindler decides unexpectedly to evaluate his life... He turns over his gains into a noble cause - and virtually takes his workers away from being swallowed up by the Holocaust... In one of the film's most touching scenes, Schindler goes to Auschwitz and fights for the freedom of the wives and children of his workers... Ben Kingsley plays the role of Itzhak Stern, the timid gifted accountant, and the silent partner wary of his employer and the enemy... Stern (spared from the horrors of the holocaust) is also Schindler's good angel... He occasionally reminds the audacious man that he could get in a lot of trouble if his true motives are ever discovered... Kingley delivers history's judgment of Oskar Schindler in a touching moment: 'Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.' Ralph Fiennes brilliantly portrays Amon Goethe, the complex study of a sadistic true monster... He is a heartless and cruel killer, with a complicated, twisted personality... Stripped to the waist and overlooking the prison yard, he leaves his mistress Ingrid (Beatrice Macola) in bed to shoot arbitrarily, with his scope rifle, slow-moving Jews from the veranda of his high villa... Goeth despises Jews, yet he inexplicably falls in love with a shy Jewish maid, Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz). Rather than allowing himself to touch her, and nearly committing the capital crime of kissing her, he remembers that he is supposed to hate her, and beats her ruthlessly for seducing him... Goeth is a man to despise... But the full scope of his atrocities are not entirely shown... Spielberg shows carefully as much of the horror as the screen can bear... The savage scenes are difficult to watch... Spielberg's camera pans to the pillar of dark smoke rising from the chimney stack into the frightening sky of Auschwitz, and to the lines of Jews unknowingly lead toward the gas chambers... Spielberg captures the terror of the Nazi reign in the terrifying dramatic moments when stunned women and children are mistakenly sent to Auschwitz... The disturbing images of arbitrary murder are harshly realistic... 'Schindler's List' assaults the viewer with lasting images of Jewish prisoners announcing their names as they are registered, given work assignments, or separated into ""essential"" and ""non-essential."" Spielberg focuses on children and uses them both as victimizers and victims... In a powerful way to personalize the slaughter without a single word, Spielberg colors the coat of a little girl as she is invisibly making her way, aimless and alone, through the chaotic destruction of the Krakow ghetto... (It's almost the same shade as the jacket worn by the young protagonist of Spielberg's 'Empire of the Sun', in a similar situation when he's alone in a mob and trying to find his way home). 'Schindler's List' is a tribute to those who lost their lives in the Holocaust, a dramatic recreation of that dark, frightening period during World War II... The horror is alleviated, slightly, by Janusz Kaminski's stunning Black and White cinematography... The lack of color reminds us of German Expressionist films, and allows Spielberg to be explicit without becoming tastelessly graphic... John Williams' tragic and somber, almost unnoticed score adds to the melancholy tone... Spielberg's great visual moments - when, in a scene, Schindler joins the Nazis on the platform as they fire the cold water at the cars on the desperate, suffocating people inside... 'Schindler's List' is an outstanding movie... It has an important role in adding credibility to the Holocaust, and in Thomas Keneally's fact-based novel, Spielberg finds the right balance of redemption and sorrow.. He makes us watch and feel the extermination through the actions of Oskar Schindler...",0.0
903,"Superb; Vertigo is the ultimate film.  It is my favorite film and in my opinion should have been rated much higher in the AFI's top 100 movies of all time list.  It outdoes Psycho and North By Northwest even though those are superb films as well.  I realize that Psycho set standars for years to come, and North By Norhtwest set standards for script-wrting, directorial techniques, etc....but Vertigo was simply a masterpeice made.  Nothing was revolutionized (except Hitch's technique of falling bodies), but instead a wonderful movie was made that can show just how much the human mind can toy with feelings and emotions.  Not only is the cinematography and acting remarkable in this film, but the heart-breaking score by the great Bernard Herrmann would also have to be the high point in this film.  When you listen to the score, you feel all the emotions that are running through the film and through the charachters head.  Never before could this have been expressed in a film, and it has never been done again in film.  There have been many attempts and superb films as well that have tried to express the same emotions--but none have succeeded more then Vertigo.  This was Alfred Hitchcocks personal favorite of his own--and I do not blame him.  All elements come together:  James Stewart and Kim Novak's electrifying performances, Bernard Herrmann's legendary score, the superb scenery of San Francisco, and the love and passion expressed through the chracters by a remarkable script.  The thing to top off Vertigo is the scene where Judy comes out of the bathroom and reveals herself as this illusion woman (Madeline).  There is so much passion in this scene it truly has to be one of the most remarkable scenes in the history of film.  When one takes all these elements into hand, Vetigo can without a doubt be considered one of the 3, if not the greatest, movie of all time.",0.0
527,"You must see it at least once; It gets a rare 10/10 from me although it is not on my Top 10 List, mostly because it isn't a movie that anyone really enjoys watching as much as one that needs to be watched. In any case I sure can't be in a laid back mindset ready to watch an action flick and substitute Schindler's List at the last second; I gotta be ready for it. I've watched it 3-4 times, the first time in a theater with my sister who was dying of cancer and wanted to see it. I remember one of her sons theorized that the Holocaust never happened and it was a way to justify the destruction of the Nazi regime, or some other BS, that I've heard variations of before. They just don't have any grounding in history. Even the Nazis who were hung for it didn't deny it; they were just following orders. Its quite a movie with all the talent both on and off the screen doing some of their best work ever. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes really should've won Oscars, but it won so many others I suppose they wanted to spread them around a little. The fairly recently released DVD package is a bit of a throwback with an odd case and a single double-sided DVD. If there's some special reason for it I don't know what it is. It has a DTS soundtrack but the B&W video was quite harsh on my screen with very bright interior lighting sometimes bombing details to smithereens. I had to adjust my screen to watch it. I don't recall that on the old laserdisc or anywhere else. It gets quite a bit lower 7/10 rating.",0.0

8874,"Definitely one of the best films I've seen.; Shaun of the Dead isn't so much a parody of the ""Of the Dead"" films as some would assume at first. The concept is essentially, ""How would everyday people react when the zombie apocalypse happens?"" There aren't any dark, mysterious pasts behind any of these characters. They're everyday people, dealing with everyday problems... ...with zombies. What's fantastic about this film is the way it covers several genres, no matter how unorthodox in fashion. Of course, this is primarily a comedy, so almost every moment has some humor. When everything seems bleakest, there's always something to lighten the mood somewhat, whether it be a reference to something earlier in the film, or something as simple as Ed's ""I got wood"" T-shirt. There's always humor to it, no matter how subtle. If you're a fan of the horror genre, this won't disappointed, as there are some generally uncomfortable moments. Still, fantastic overall. If you haven't seen it yet, please go out and rent it, or even better, buy it. You owe it to yourself.",0.0

4326,"Attack On Terror Made For TV 1975 Was Better.; This movie was based on the murders of the three civil rights workers in 1964. Attack On Teror really gave a better view in story line, than Mississippi Burning. These three workers were jailed by the Deputy Sheriff on a speeding ticket. After they were released, they were on their way South out of town. Later they were followed by the Deputy Sheriff along with Ku Klux Klan members. On a country road they were pulled over shot and killed. The blue station wagon was burn't. The three were found buried in a Dam yard. This was world attention, in the news. It was all about hate not just against blacks, but also a Jew. Personally I hate the Confederate Flag. It's a symbol of hate, white supremacy and of course the KU Klux Klan. I like only the American Flag and the Christain Flag. There was no excuse for the murder of these three men. They came to investigate a church fire. No matter whether it's a white church or a black church, burning down the Lord's house is wrong. I likewise didn't like Gene Hackman's brutal tactics in this movie. Where he took the razor, from the Barber gave the Deputy Sheriff a shave, cutting his face, then dunking his head in a sink full of water. That's not how law enforcement officers should act. I would encourage you all to get the real facts and watch Attack On Terror. You will get a better story, than this low budget movie.",0.0
1175,"Always clever, frequently exhausting; Jeunet and Caro made an auspicious debut with this comedy trifle. It's alarmingly full of mechanical gags and originality. Any sequence in this movie could be extracted and garner much admiration, but 30 superficially clever segments in a row begins to wear on a viewer. Being accosted with each new episodic conceit actually becomes exhausting. And when a even a brief respite from all the hyperactivity is needed, it's not to be found. Humans are mined as a source of delight for behavioral aberrations, but no one connects with anyone to any real degree. The movie refuses to go deeper into anything. Jeunet and Caro at this point, are still in love with props. Delicatessen is emotionally chilly. The two obviously love the old silent clowns, Tati, Chaplin, Keaton, etc, and it's sillier than you ever imagined a French movie could be. But it's around a thousand percent better than their next film; the truly god-awful atrocity City of Lost Children. By the time Jeuenet (w/o Caro) made Amelie, he had found some much needed humanity, and calmed down.",0.0
527,"An upbeat holocaust movie?; Only Stephen Spielberg could make a film about the holocaust where the point is that none of the major characters do NOT die.  To me the message is lost because of this and the film becomes a glorification of one man surrounded by the deaths of millions.  Oscar Schindler was a Nazi embroiled in the holocaust and the second world war.  He managed to save his friends, yet profited from concentration camps.  Ok, so he wasn't an anti-semite bent on destruction, but he only saved people he was connected to, and their families. And the evil Nazis in this film are all slightly comical.  Where is the evil?  Where is the horror?  Where is all the death and torture and misery. Scrape the surface of this film and you find a gratuitous ""entertainment"" movie.

You'd see here the amount of destruction and deaths that were caused by the Nazis. You'd think that they are really the most ruthless and violent people in the face of the earth. The acting here is great. Everyone does their best. Liam Neeson is amazing here. Every emotion that he feels can be seen in his eyes and when he sees a random pedestrian getting murdered, you'd perfectly see that he feels sympathy for he victim and anger towards the Nazis. The near end scene here shows a burst of emotion from him. That scene is just spot on perfect in every way. You could see all the pain he kept in him and he opened up to a crowd of Jews. There are a lot of frightening scenes here especially the burning bodies scene. It just shows how many people the Nazis have killed and they still manage to be angry at the Jews. Like I said this film is an experience, it changes the way you see people and it makes you sonder. No other film has made me feel so sad.

8874,"Usage of Queen Music:Always a Bonus!; I just saw this film a few days ago on video--I don't recall if it ever made it to my hometown,it might've made it to Lawrence,which is 20 plus miles east of here--and was VERY impressed. I found myself drawing comparisons of this show to the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake,which came out both in theatre and video/DVD relatively close to each other. While I liked and was sufficiently entertained by DOTD 2004,I was more impressed with this effort,mostly due to the copious amount of comedy and pathos that gives this zombie flick a little more depth(I also enjoyed this ending more than DOTD's,but that would be a spoiler if I told you why). The English sensibility of this film(i.e. a lot of arguing,a sort of Soccer-hooligan sensibility to its violence)makes the horror element of this film both real and hilarious,no mean feat there! The hero,Shaun,you become familiar with as a basically good guy with low aspirations and a sinking sense of boredom in life. His best friend,Ed,is a disgusting yet amiable loser and his girlfriend,Liz,might seem grating and prattling on first observation,but she is basically kind and sensible,a perfect foil for Shaun. The fact that zombies are taking over London slowly sinks in,and isn't helped by the fact that(and this bit I have no doubt was the filmmakers tongue-in-cheek jab at London/British urban lifestyle)many locals are already lethargic,slow-moving,inarticulate sorts. There is much confusion over who is undead and who is merely drunk in this film,and there are some great visual similarities between the undead and Shaun himself. By the time it is eminently clear that London,perhaps all of England and maybe even the world,is being overtaken by the walking dead,it becomes a full-on race and struggle for survival. Par for the course there,the signature of any ordinary film of this genre. But the way the principal characters react to the situation and each other is both very palpable,aggravating(it doesn't dawn on them until about 2/3 of the way through the film that they should SHOOT THE ZOMBIES IN THE HEAD?)and funny. The ending may seem a bit of a cop-out for some,but it fits the rhythm of the movie as it was set up. Horror-comedies are rare(and I'm ready to give a rhetorical beat-down to the next person who thinks the ""Scream"" movies are parodies. The ""Scary Movie"" films ARE.)and probably somewhat difficult to make. I suppose ""Love at First Bite"" or ""American Werewolf in London"" might be considered examples. But this film is able to balance the scares,gore and other conventions of thriller flicks with - daffy,pratfall comedy,and that makes this film very special. The amount of pop music references and usage(Queen in particular)is something that sealed the deal for me. I probably would've voted a 9.5 for this one,since I don't really fancy myself a horror movie aficionado,but since you cannot vote like that on IMDb,so I rounded up.",0.0

This is one of those rare movies that makes you go beyond empathizing with the characters and actually helps you to gain a better understanding of yourself. The main character (played superbly by Robert Sean Leonard) faces universal conflicts that every man has faced since the beginning of time--which is finding your own destiny and having the courage to create your own path in life. But the problem is treated with the perfect degree of sensitivity, passion and intricacy so that the characters could have in fact been anyone who was watching this movie. All characters are believably touching; along with 'Awakenings', this is Robin Williams' finest work to date.",0.0
48385,"You'll laugh hysterically; Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, starring Sacha Baron Cohen as the title character, is becoming one of the most talked about movies of the year. Borat, one of the three characters from Cohen's Da Ali G Show, is a completely naive and moronic character that Cohen plays with so much conviction that it's actually scary. One even wonders whether Cohen is a genius or a madman. Borat is directed by Larry Charles, whose previous efforts were the disappointing Bob Dylan vehicle, Masked and Anonymous, and several episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm. All these projects had major creative input by their respective stars, Bob Dylan, and Larry David, as does his new film. Shot in a mockumentary-style, the film chronicles Kazakh reporter Borat and his overweight producer (Ken Davitian) in their adventures in the ""U.S. and A."" They are sent to create a documentary about our globalizing culture. However, Borat quickly falls in love with Pamela Anderson after seeing her on a rerun of Baywatch, and the plot ultimately turns into Borat's quest to California to marry Anderson. What's interesting is that Cohen, a Jew, is actually speaking a combination of Hebrew and Yiddish with a Polish accent in his subtitled mumblings. The film's plot is very weak. However, it's extremely doubtful that anyone in the audience would actually care, as they would be too busy laughing hysterically. Cohen finds humor in the reactions of everyday people in response to Borat's antics and candid inquiries. Cohen seems to never stop, as the movie is basically funny the whole way through. Cohen and Charles even accomplish the unthinkable in this film by creating sympathy for such a repulsive and clueless character. Completely broke, lonely and out of gas, Borat creates a fire for himself outside a building, and one actually feels sorry for him. Though Borat appears like such a despicable character, in reality, he is far too moronic to hate. Cohen might actually be making a statement concerning racism with this film, because beyond his tongue-in-cheek shtick, Borat unknowingly reveals what kinds of people are actually out there, the nice, along with the bigots and sexists. Even Borat himself proclaims he hates gays and Jews, but it becomes apparent that he has never even met either until his voyage into America. The bottom line is, no matter how stupid the plot is, and how politically incorrect it may be, this movie is completely hilarious all the way through.",0.0

4388,"The end of civilization as we know it.; If the first movie wasn't bad enough, the sequel only confirms that we are living in the declining years of a decadent society with a blinded sense of esthetics, an amoral soul and the intelligence of club moss. YES, I know this movie is parody, but parody can be funny, witty, and sophisticated without resorting to crass vulgarity and filth for its own sake. This film only proves that Hollywood continues to cater to the lowest common (very common!) denominator (or is it that Hollywood continues to define the lowest common denominator?) and that the vast majority of movie going audiences have the brains of a degenerate ferret.   I am no prude. Vulgarity and shock value have their place. They should be the spices and seasonings on the entree, not the entree itself. This piece of work is a hollow mockery of what real parody should be and only moves us that much closer to the total collapse of social responsibility.",0.0
6493,"winning combination; First of all I would just like to point out that Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson are two of this generation's greatest contributions to the acting community. Everything I have seen these two in has been top quality in it's own right, and I think that the casting for this film was perfect.  I had been waiting for a long time to see these two together.  I think that the storyline of this movie is very interesting, and the fact that Wilson and Hudson switch back and forth between the characters in the book and their real life identities is adorable.  You can't help but smile as they fall for each other.  I think that the only grade D this movie deserves is a D for Delightful.  I wouldn't say that this is the best movie I have ever seen, but it certainly is not the worst, and it does make for an enjoyable time. So if you had any desire to see this movie before you came on IMDB, don't be discouraged by other reviews.  Go out and rent this movie, and enjoy it.",0.0
48385,"The Comedy of the Year, by FAR!!!; So, I just saw Borat: Cultural Learnings of America to Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, at a special Black Carpet screening in Philadelphia, and I am still laughing the next day. Sacha Boren Cohen is a brilliant satirist, and instead of making fun of a person, he allows the person to make fun of themselves. This is witnessed most strikingly at the soon to be famous ""rodeo"" scene, which is as follows. ATTENTION: THIS PARAGRAPH CONTAINS SPOILERS Borat and his producer arrange for him to sing the national anthem at rodeo. While he is getting ready to go out in the arena, he gets tips from an old cowboy, who tells him to ""cut off his mustache so he can at least pass for eye-tali-an."" When Borat tries to kiss him ""as his custom"", the guy says the only people who do that here are homos. Borat makes a comment that in his country they are rounded up and kept in jail, the rodeo guy says ""strung up? Well we're trying to do that here too!"" All in all, this movie will be either loved, or hated, there is NO middle ground. Either people will laugh harder than they've ever laughed before, or be so outraged and disgusted that they will petition to have it removed from theaters.",0.0
4326,"Mesmerising Gene; I found Mississippi Burning an amazing film mainly because of the performances of its two leads, but mainly because of the mesmerising performance of Gene Hackman. I have never known an actor so adept at acting with his eyes in a way that makes his performances so watchable and call for repeated viewing. In a similar way I thought his performance in ""The Chamber"", whilst being only an average film, was amazing. All that being said, I felt that criticisms of the film itself are totally justified. Mississippi Burning portrays the blacks as weak camera-fodder victims seemingly without any involvement in any fight for civil liberties, and the portrayal of white FBI as Liberation fighters for the Black cause, who themselves instigated the end of American 'apartheid'! A little less naivety and more honest reality would have improved this film to the classic it could have so easily been.",0.0

It's the predictable zombie movie with the usual gore and violence. I chuckled at a few parts, but overall it was rather drab and boring. The beginning was quirky and humorous, but as it went on it seemed as if they had run out of ideas and completely lost the plot. Perhaps I just have a short attention span, but by the last half hour or so I couldn't concentrate on it at all. Not to mention it actually got a bit sad at parts, which I really didn't expect coming from a comedy. Really the only thing that held this movie together was the decent casting. I wouldn't say the movie was downright terrible, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a real quality picture.",0.0

Meaning, if you are a fan of Ali G and Borat you will find this movie hilarious. Hopefully you will find it funny even if you aren't. Tonight was the first public screening and the majority of the packed audience seemed to eat it up. I haven't laughed like that in a movie for quite some time. It is extremely crude with multiple full frontal male nudity shots which add to the humor of the film. I don't mean to say that it is inappropriate though. Those who take it for what it is will find it absolutely hilarious. I was surprised that so much antisemitism was included since it was a feature film. If a person didn't know that he is Jewish in real life I'm sure they would be truly offended. As for the format of the film, it is a blend between narrative and real footage. However it's very difficult to tell which parts are real and which are not and I will be very curious to find out if several of the bits were real or staged. There were times when I thought that I was watching something real and unscripted only for something to happen that seemed all too convenient for fitting into the plot thus prompting my curiosity. If you like Ali G or Borat (who is my favorite of his persona) then you have to check this movie out whenever it comes to theaters.",0.0
527,"One of the most important films in out time; Schindler's List in my opinion one of the best films ever made - furthermore, it's a monument for all of those who did have to courage to do something good, however small. Oskar Schindler was no stereotypical hero, on the contrary, he had many faults which were wonderfully portrayed in the film. Strangely, the film - however serious it was - was entertaining, too, which is rather remarkable: There seems to be a general belief in most of ""serious"" critics (and filmmakers) that a good, serious film with a difficult theme has to be unsuccessful - take a look at some film which critics did like, and you'll find a lot of commercial, unsuccessful, boring films, for example Fassbender's films. If you take a closer look at the criticism uttered by some of ""serious"" critics, you'll note that they stick to the credo above - a ""good"" movie must not be a successful movie. I've watched the movie 1994 and I'm not sure if I'm going to watch it again - it is till the present day the most moving, stirring movie I've seen - and the first (and only) only in which I've actually cried. So, I've you're going to watch Schindler's List (which I strongly recommend), do yourself a favor: don't plan  anything entertaining till the next day - I wasn't able to do so after watching it. 10 Points out of 10.

71057,"One of the best films of the year!!  And done of the best animated films of all time; I first heard about ""9"" like most people did, sitting a dark movie theater waiting for my movie to play. And as I was waiting a quaint and dark little trailer started to roll it showed a bombed out city and as I watched I became more and more intrigued at the premise of the film and the dark, Gothic style it infused with the brilliant and breathtaking animation. But I didn't see it it until about a month later and now I'm regretting not having seen it while it was in theaters, Shane Acker and Tim Burton's ""9"" is brilliant, heartbreaking, dark, intense, breathtaking and at sometimes scary. ""9"" is not a movie I would show my three step-sisters, the reason is is that ""9"" is at sometimes very scary and is a little too dark and violent for the mainstream children audience of 5-9 but.The age group of 10-50 may enjoy this film much more than the younger seeing as it is aimed at the more adult and teenage audience. But with that said ""9"" is a sweeping animated epic that sucks you into a dystopia world and takes you on an adventure the likes you've never seen before, this film get's it's themes straight from the visionary minds of producer Tim Burton and Director Shane Acker they create a vision of a destroyed world and tell you a story of the nine little voodoo dolls that have to save civilization, It's quite a fascinating story and will surely entertain you while it blows your mind as well. Some people think this film doesn't deserve much acclaim or praise, but I'm sorry to say this film deserves every bit of the praise It something new and fresh and not kiddish at all but it does teach some great morals in it like friendship, overcoming your fear and rising to the occasion to be more than what you really are. All in all ""9"" is a fun, fantastic, action packed, dark and mythic Sci-Fi animated epic like no other. Elijah wood, Jennifer Connelly, Martin Landau, John C. Reilly, Christoper Plummer and Fred Tatasciore are all fantastic in this as the nine voodoo dolls tasked with stopping the deadly machines. They all bring something different to there characters. Elijah wood(9) brings a soft spoken and heroic prowess to his young character, and he makes 9 more of a hero than a coward he turns him into a leader that is small but has a big heart(metaphorically speaking.). Fred Tatsciore(you may know him as the man who voices Bruce Banner in The Ultimate Avengers.) Brings a strong but dim bulled wit to his character 8, his style and power is more driven toward brute force than brains seeing as 8 is the giant out of the nine, but none the less he brings a little likability to a rather not so likable character. Jennifer Connelly(7) Is tough, smart and strong, she is the second in command to 9, or that's how I see it. Connelly brings her toughness and power to an already impressive and imposing character. 7 is the strongest and the fighter out of the group, she is a force of nature and is not to be taken lightly. Crispin Glover(6) brings a quirky and Tim Burton type charm to this film as the lovable and misunderstood painter of the group, he's fantastic in the scenes he's in and he really brings the kindness and gentle quality to this film. John C. Reilly(5) plays the very friendly and caring 5, hr brings more than what is needed and that is alright because that humanizes the film and brings out of the extreme darkness set by the films story. while the twins 3 and 4 don't say anything they are very sweet and timid characters and are great to have on screen. Martin Landau(2) is the old quirk out of them. And while he may not have much screen time h e does do good at bringing a friendly and smart quality to his character. Christopher Plummer(1) Is the crass, cowardly and not so great leader of the nine. His character believes in hiding instead of learning the truth behind what has happened to the world around them and fighting back, but none the less Plummer does great with his character and brings great power to him. But all in all the cast does a fantastic job n this film and really elevates it to true greatness among the animated films. ""9"" Is fantastic in every way imaginable and may not be very suitable for small children but anyone with a love of Tim Burton and his dark world will enjoy this film as much as I did. It's a fun filled Science Fiction epic that has ushered the way for more mature animated films and the breathtaking CGI effects and action sequences are more well worth the price of rental or admission. All in all ""9"" delivers.",0.0
527,"Missed the Point; I don't want to say that this film is bad. I am part Jewish, though my family, at least the part that I know about, was already in the the U.S. I hate that this is THE film about the holocaust, because to say anything negative about the film has become almost an antisemitic statement, as characterized by the Seinfield episode where Jerry has sex in the movie theater playing this film. This film is just not a top ten film any way that you cut it. The acting is good. The camera work is stellar. This is a beautiful film. There are parts to this film that are pure genius. The concept of fleeting life and showing characters shot dead and flailing lifelessly are amongst the most poignant and cinematic in the history of film. So why is this film ""over rated."" It was Kubrick that once said that this film is about hope in the face of loss, and the holocaust was about that very loss and the failing of humanity to stop it. Like many of Spielberg's films, this is a melodrama that attempts to educate us about this tragedy through our heart. So much of the plot is dedicated to the womanizing of the title character to exhibit his arc. This is a film about one man's redemption in how he saves the Jews. It is much in the way that Saving Private Ryan is about redemption in combat and saving that one man. This films are about saving things with tragedy in the backdrop. The tragedy and the random horrors of life are never treated seriously. While Schindler's Jews survived, many of the Jews that even made it to the end of the war did not. Many more did not than did. By trying to show civilization's humanity during a period of time where it did not exist, you attempt to own history and look down at it from a place of contempt. We know so much better.",0.0

527,"Speilberg's best film; Schindler's List is a powerful look at the horrors of the holocaust carried by the awe-inspiring performances of Liam Neeson and Ralphe Finnes.  Spielberg shocked everyone, including me, with the film's incredibly realistic and mercilessly blunt examination of Oskar Schindler and what he did for the Jews in WWII.  The film is graphic and disturbing, rarely over-using music (Spielberg seems to be the only director who knows when to put a leash on John Williams) to enhance the dramatic punch of what's happening on screen.  Many have claimed that the only reason this film is so respected is because of it's realism, that critics were afraid to raise the notion that the film might not be above ""normal criticism.""

He managed to be compelling and charismatic and scary as hell all at the same time. Actually, so did Gene Hackman, which I think was intentional--the filmmakers wanted us to notice the very thin line between Hackman's ex-sheriff character and Sartain's Sheriff Stuckey. I thought the movie was a little heavy-handed, and its obvious attempts to be powerful and moving made me wince at times.

527,"A truly terrifying picture.; Schindler's List is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Kingsley, Caroline Goodall, Jonathan Sagalle and Embeth Davidtz. In German-occupied Poland during World War II, Oskar Schindler gradually becomes concerned for his Jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the Nazi Germans. Steven Spielberg's horrifically harrowing Schindler's List isn't just a critically acclaimed, award-winning masterpiece. This is a documentary of real life events, a truly terrifying picture which chronicles The Holocaust, within the most destructive period of our time. A time that must never be repeated. Captured masterfully in black-and-white celluloid with hand-held cameras, Schindler's List follows Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a German industrialist who begins to feel concerned for his Jewish workforce, leading to an emotionally captivating story that evolves continuously as Steven Zaillian's beautiful screenplay culminates to one of Schindler's final heartbreaking lines: ""I could have got more out. I could have got more. I don't know. If I'd just I could have got more."" Liam Neeson showcases a raw talent as Schindler, performing skilfully throughout. Every line is delivered with absolute care and feels entirely realistic. His interactions with Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) are some of the greater scenes in the film, most specifically the creation of the list. Kingsley has always proved himself an incredible supporting act. Ralph Fiennes also plays alongside Neeson as Amon Goeth, a ruthless and negligent SS captain who murders for sport. Eventually, Goeth is told that power is in fact to never kill, but pardon a man. It never truly connects with him, but continues his work with it in mind. This is one of Fiennes' greatest, most pre-eminent performances to date. The decision to shoot the film in black-and-white only catapults the 'documentary tone' that Spielberg sets out to achieve, and in doing so creates an eerie experience for viewers. There's one scene in particular that uses colour for a little girl's red coat, as she stumbles through a disturbing site of bloody murder whilst Schindler keeps a close eye. This scene essentially serves as the brutal realisation for Schindler, and becomes one of the most iconic scenes in film history. A simply breathtaking use of colour within a black-and-white picture. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski expresses his enduring adroitness with excellent execution. John Williams' haunting score captures the horrors of war as violinist Itzhak Perlman performs every single note with intricate skill. The main theme is pleasing to the ears but when paired with Spielberg's picture, it's painfully distressing, traumatic, even disturbing. 'Jewish Town' continues that same feeling, but explores Williams & Perlman's impeccable talent further. This is a fine example of the perfect film score. Verdict; It may be a tough subject and a difficult experience to bear, but Schindler's List is a film to be seen by all. Schindler's List Â– â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… (8/10)",0.0

1080,"Still underrated; I love 'the Holy Grail' but it is still a very uneven film, which feels more like a set of good comedic sketches rather than a film. But Monty Python's ultimate success in the film genre is (in my opinion!) the Life of Brian.  It is easily the most satisfying film experience, a fantastic story, laughs all the way, but with a healthy dose of pathos and cutting observation that speaks as much to our weaknesses to-day as to the constant 'civilised' absurdities that repeat themselves throughout history. So I was surprised to see that The Holy Grail is much more highly rated internationally than Life of Brian:  I assume this owes to its popularity in the States.  It is also fair to say that I am surprised that either film is rated at all outside of Britain, because comedy rarely travels well, and this is particularly off-beat, surreal juxtaposition of outrageousness with repression.  It is also Graham Chapman's finest hour, and the fact that this was one of the few times when he was entirely sober (totally the opposite of the Holy Grail) shines through in a consistent and moving performance that elevates the movie beyond 'just for laughs'. It is often mistaken for having a dig at Christianity; however it (whether intentionally or not) lampoons fanaticism, faith, organisations, fate and historical accuracy.  I suppose if I was looking for a reason for it to 'offend' it would be that it implies that people needed a Jesus figure, and whether one existed or not, they were going to have one (even if it was Brian); but I am also certain that that was not the intentional message of the movie. I wonder whether it doesn't click with people who are keen on 'religious' TV channels, or the preacher culture? I certainly want to know others opinions. Most importantly, however, is to not take this movie seriously, it is in the end a very funny comedy that can touch you, has loads of applicability (not allegory!), and improves with repeated viewings.

It's not like they were exciting car chases. It's not my favorite Hitchcock movie. I did like James Stewart when he gets obsessive. He's good in that section. As for being too old for the part, that to me seems to work for him in this movie. His obsession becomes more self-destructive. It has a creepiness to it. I have to admit that I didn't recognize Novak as Judy Barton. It confused me a bit at first. I think people of that era would have an easier time recognizing Kim Novak. As homage to its importance and inventive camera work, I'll add an extra point or else I would have given it 7/10.",0.0
4886,"The Britney Spears of CGI - Oops! Pixar's done it again...; 10 reasons why ""Monsters, Inc."" was robbed by ""Shrek"" at the Oscars: 1. The writing holds together better - there isn't a single wasted bit in the movie, from the simulation at the beginning to the seemingly pointless croaky-voiced martinet for paperwork who turns out to be... but that would be telling. 2. The humour is less scatological and more character-based. 3. The animation is so effective that it's hard to believe it's animation (two highlights are Sullivan's sleigh ride down a snowy mountain at night and the door chase climax - door chase? Just see the movie)... 4. ...but the movie never gives you a chance to just wind up being amazed at how it looks and forget about how it feels. 5. It doesn't try and impress you with its pop-culture references and how clever it is generally (there is a restaurant called Harryhausen's, but that doesn't really count). 6. The voice performances; one of the tests of a cartoon is if the voice cast isn't distracting, and save the Abominable Snowman (voice of John ""Cliff Clavin"" Ratzenberger) that isn't the case. Kudos all round, but particularly Crystal, Goodman, Coburn, and Bonnie Hunt as the aforementioned martinet (see #1). 7. Only one ""proper"" song, and even then it's by the great Randy Newman. 8. The relationship between Sullivan and Boo (the little girl who gets into Monstropolis) is genuinely touching. 9. The end credits not only feature always welcome ""outtakes"" but also follow up a plot strand from the movie itself. 10. No DreamWorks tit-for-tat pokes. But then, they don't need to - movies like ""Toy Story,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Toy Story 2"" and this one speak for themselves.",0.025

1080,"Brian.  Greatest comedy of all time, Period !!; Now, if you're a Jerry Lewis fan ( excepting the frogs for whom admiring is a way of re emasculating themselves after getting their ass's kicked for most of the 20th century ) or ye be a Three Stooge's fan no way this speaks to you. Yes, yes I know the AFI #1 comedy is that; "" Some Like It Hot' OK, not bad, but aside from Marylin's incredible tush what did it really bring to the table comedy wise? Cross gender ? The Brits have been doing that for a 100 yrs. The rest of the movie, while well crafted and acted, is pretty predictable in it's construct. Now here is where AFI is chickenshit . ""Life Of Brian"" is not eligible , because it's not ""American"", yet one of their 'top 5' , ""Dr. Strangelove"" is, WHY ??? Both were produced in the UK. Kicker is, as I understand it, is that 'Brian' had no US distributor therefore made it ineligible for for 'AFI' consideration. ( Please correct if wrong ). Now, I'm gonna catch hell for this, but Monty's big cash cow 'Holy Grail', does nothing for me. OK, maybe the stage thing works ( I have not seen it ), but the movie didn't, not by a long shot. Pointless, Jerry Lewis spasmodic slapstick. I call your attention to the first 'Pink Panther' movie. While Sellers was not meant to be the focus of the movie ( there were many stars in it ) his bumbling inspector became a franchise. & in each following movie it became worser ( forget spellcheck, I know I'm leaving good grammar...as if I ever had ever had any..) It was in the first 'Panther ' , that the great Mr. Sellers, did his finest work of the series. Understood , he was doing slapstick, BUT, not over the top; Jerry Lewis, 3 Stooges , in your face stupid buffoonery, it was always in denial, & that's what made it great. ( OK a couple of bits may have been a push, but the rest; pillcrunching in the bathroom etc., you must give credit for the wonderful subtlety of his performance ). Well, that's where I am, humor in any form , only works if it is not an in your face farce, but has a wry edge. Preferably keenly sharp, intelligent, and to the bone. AND that is 'Life Of Brian'.

1246,"SPOILER Peter Weir's 'earlier' masterpiece; DEAD POETS SOCIETY is, in my opinion, Peter Weir's 'earlier' masterpiece before his 'later' masterpiece, 2003's MASTER AND COMMANDER. Both films were nominated for Best Picture by the Academy and both lost (the latter to Peter Jackson's unstoppable LORD OF THE RINGS/RETURN OF THE KING). However, 'loser' is a heavily relative term, especially when it comes to the Oscars, and the Best Picture nominations of both films alone speaks volumes: Weir is truly a cinematic visionary and a consummate director. The visceral, emotional power of DPS, which seems to impact the subconscious directly, is something I've pondered deeply and carefully for over a decade now. One certainly experiences it consciously in the film's shattering juxtaposition of the youthful exuberance for life and the awakening of self-discovery/self-understanding among the DPS students with its total negation-Neil's self-destruction and his friends' brutal realization of human frailty and mortality. Certainly, those things are 'up front and center' in this film. Even so, my personal sense is that the film's greatest emotional power stems from and is communicated through its fabulous use of foreshadowing/parallelism(s) and assorted kinds of symbolism, subtle elements that are not often mentioned in discussions of DPS. So I would argue that there is a kind of mystical or even 'predestinarian' subtext at work behind the film's dialogue, action and character development as well. While Tom Schulman's Academy Award-winning script (which I have an autographed copy of in front of me as I write this) proceeds from a rather superficial premise-an overly caricatured confrontation between philosophical liberalism and conservatism (i.e., Keating vs. Welton Academy generally and Mr. Nolan specifically)-it nonetheless contains all the necessary essentials for Weir's elevation of this coming-of-age drama to something far more eloquent and profound than what the confrontation-of-personified-philosophical-viewpoints framework alone provides. Judging from the accounts I've read of the directing and shooting of DPS, Weir accomplished this elevation by 'filling the role of John Keating' himself for his student-character cast, Robin Williams, and the entire crew. Weir challenged his actors (just as Keating challenged his students) and drew out of them their best creative and collaborative efforts, even allowing them varying degrees of license to invent their own dialogue and action-and not just Robin Williams, whose bread and butter is improvisation, but the student character actors also, who were only '18 after all' (Robert Sean Leonard's own words, in a note he wrote to me in November 1996). What this adds up to is a group of outstanding young actors 'coming of age' in their own lives and careers through Weir's mentoring at the very time they were playing student characters undergoing the same thing at Keating's hand; thus, Weir gets irrepressibly dynamic and believable performances from Hawke, Leonard, Charles, Hansen, Kussman, Ruggiero, Waterston, et al. I've read that DPS was filmed in sequence and suspect that the 'real time' shooting progression only enhanced the 'Weir/Keating' effect further. I mentioned foreshadowing, parallelism(s) and symbolism above, and while there are many examples of those elements throughout the film-too many to recount here, unfortunately-I should note that they all seem to converge, rather like a lens which powerfully focuses sunlight down to a single, burning point, during the 'signature Peter Weir moment' in DPS-the scene in which Neil dons Puck's crown for the last time and then slowly bows his head while standing bare-chested at his opened bedroom window before the frosty, mystical night air. (A truly Thoreau-esque moment as well.) In support of my surmise that Neil's window scene is THE pivotal moment in DPS (just as the Neil/Todd character pair/cross-vectored interchange are the central CHARACTER/PLOT focus of the film), I would only ask other DPS viewers to consider how FORCEFULLY the window scene culminates and epiphanies many earlier elements of the film's dialogue, plot, sound, and visual imagery, and WHY it does so. When you unravel the various parallelism's, foreshadowing and symbolism(s), DPS suddenly reveals its hidden depths and extra dimensions, which in turn make it apparent that the film is art of the highest order. And-again-all of this is Peter Weir's doing-e.g., the novelization of the script doesn't carry anything APPROACHING the emotional wallop that the film wields. A postscript: The extended/Director's cut version of the film (aired some years ago on the USA Network) is preferable to the current US/Region 1 DVD release because the additional footage helps lay important developmental groundwork for all that I've mentioned above. So my personal hope is that an extended version DVD (whose production is preferably overseen by Peter Weir himself) will also be released some day soon. This magnificent film deserves it. Kudos and best wishes to Peter Weir and all his 'students.' Donald Campfield, D.M.A. 11/19/04",0.0

1246,"one of the most amazing and uplifting movie experiences that I had ever had; Dead Poets Society is hands down one of the most powerful and upfliting movies that I have seen-and trust me I have seen many powerful movies.

I myself can relate to Todd, shy and a bit insecure of who he is. John Keating-played by Robin Williams-is a teacher who believes in more then just teaching about whats in the books, he believes in teaching about *life* and seazing the day. This movie shows how important it is to live each day to your fullest and to follow your dreams. I have seen many powerful films, and Dead Poets Society is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. It captures the essance of what a film should to do a person. It shows a different view of life and makes you question things. It brings tears in your eyes as well as laughter. Even though I get emotional during films very rarly do I cry in them, but I did cry during the end of the movie with what happened to Neil and Keating. The ending to this day had a powerful effect on me and not many movies has an effect on you to the point where you get emotional and uplifted just thinking about the movie.

1246,"Who's Remembered Most?; After these impressionable students graduate and go on to adult endeavors, do they remember the poets and poetry they studied--and are moved to read more? Or do they more fondly recall their colorful and unconventional teacher, with his unorthodox style of putting over his subject? True, poetry has taken a down slide since the fifties, and for many adults, they hardly crack a book all year, though their library displays may be full. And when they do read, the last thing seems to be poetry. So, Prof. John Keating has his work cut out: get the class' attention right off the bat, and keep holding it with innovative techniques. This he does, including standing on the table, doing imitations of Brando and Wayne reciting the Bard, and keeping the class on their feet and moving about. When Prof. John's taken to task, his young admirers come to his defense, which gets pretty emotional before it's over. Audiences seemed to go for this film, while critics were more divided. Robin Williams is energetic while yet being somewhat restrained, and Peter Weir's direction is quite serviceable. Maybe it's not enough to allow the poetry to intrinsically speak for itself anymore. Perhaps teachers are competing with the media for students' attention, requiring more and more ""creative"" ways to get through. Whatever the case, Prof. Keating earned his keep through sheer effort exerted, if not through traditional academic standards.",0.0

I can see that it started a trend, but why is beyond me, since it's so appallingly bad. Not only is the setup a bit silly(slow-moving brainless easy to spot zombies taking over the world? Yeah, right) but the movie takes itself so seriously, and the fans even more so. Shaun of the Dead doesn't, and that's its strength. The movie starts as a normal relationship comedy, and Shaun is our regular loser. The whole problem of the dead walking begins just as any problem; something you hear on the news but ignore because you have worse problems. People's reactions to the zombie plague (Don't say the ""z-word""!) is actually pretty realistic and also funny. The movie uses gore in a good way, and doesn't indulge in it, like the 2004 DOTD remake. Since this is not USA, the Londoners have to use cricket bats and umbrellas instead of shotguns and colts. The classic mall is replaced with a pub, and when Shauns mum tells him she's been attacked on the phone, she refers to the zombies as ""a tad bitey"". It's very British, and I love that. The cast is good, especially Pegg, who shows a great range o emotions. The two usual zombie movie emotions, fear and expressionlessness, are nowhere to be seen.

1246,"Leaves of Class; In 1959 Delaware (as Vermont), charismatic poetry teacher Robin Williams (as John Keating) arrives to begin work at the ""Welton Academy"" preparatory school for boys. An alumni of the school, Mr. Williams teaches poetry with uncommon zeal. To gain attention, he demands students tear out the pages of books written by essayists with whom he does not agree. To get participation, he invites students to stand on the teacher's desk. Williams does impersonations of Marlon Brando and John Wayne. His motto is ""Seize the Day,"" a directive made popular by novelist Saul Bellow. Yes, this class is fun... Williams teaches the ""dangers of conforming,"" and encourages students to think for themselves. When they learn Williams belonged to a clandestine club called the ""Dead Poets Society"" when he was a ""Welton"" student, the class decides to revive the group. They meet in a cave to read poetry by the masters - but, mainly, they just goof around. Playing the saxophone and sharing ""Playboy""-type centerfolds accompany Walt Whitman. Because Williams'' influence extends perilously beyond the classroom, his ""unorthodox teaching methods"" get the popular teacher in trouble with school administrators... This above average production won good notices and award consideration for director Peter Weir and star Robin Williams. Originally, the teacher held back a secret; ""Oscar""-winning writer Tom Schulman was persuaded to drop the idea, so we and the character are left with a gap. Williams' ""Keating"" is put on the sidelines in favor of the students. Nothing against the actors, who perform exceptionally, but they do look more like handsome young college-aged models than typical high-school aged boys. There is some physical diversity in the extended supporting cast, though. A few of the boys wear glasses... The main stars are sensitive writer Ethan Hawke (as Todd Anderson) and his roommate, aspiring actor Robert Sean Leonard (as Neil Perry). The next tier includes prankster Gale Hansen (as Charlie Dalton) and lovelorn Josh Charles (as Knox Overstreet). Although these players are almost interchangeable, the actors create distinguishable characters. Best of the remaining parts goes to Dylan Kussman (as Richard Cameron), who perversely turns out to be the group's real non-conformist.

5816,"Darker, more action, and well, that's it.; **********Spoiler Warning*********** This second installment of the Saga of Potter was notable mainly in how it was much grimmer and sinister in outlook.  Grimmer compared to the first movie and children's fluff in general, about average for modern movies--but still, messages in blood? I found the plot to be somewhat easier to relate to, and liked this installment a little better than the first.  Harry's friend Ron is fleshed out some more by showing his family, although in the first episode Ron was always eating something and now I guess he's cured of that.  As many people have noted all the boys have grown and changed substantially, looking far beyond the 10-12 age Potter is supposed to be around.  The only one who didn't change much was the girl who played Hermione, who's face was a little thinner and was still as cute as a button, but sadly her character doesn't contribute much this time around. Most of the problems of the first movie remain, though.  There's some better humor (the Whomping Willow comes to mind) and much more action such as the hordes of spiders, but too much foreshadowing and plot holes conveniently filled in by whatever.  (The car coming out of the blue to rescue them or Phoenix in the nick of time)  Maybe this was explained in the book, who knows.  Anyone else wonder how on earth a hundred foot long ten foot wide snake could get around by ""pipes?""  What kind of plumbing does Hogwart's have?  And *everyone* not seeing it directly?

It is a sad tragedy that such films can make it to cinemas. Do not see this film, it physically hurts your eyes and brain to do so.",0.0
3751,"A for effort, but 6 to 7 for rating; Chicken Run is a refreshing change of pace visually. And it doesn't take long to get past the clay-mation-like figures and see them as characters, not special effects. Where Chicken Run fell short was character development. While a few of the chickens had some personality, all of them (with the exception of Ginger) were so one-dimensional that really, if they didn't escape from the farm, it would have been OK with me. Now, I realize how ridiculous it is to discuss character development for clay chickens. To be honest, I'm having trouble choosing the right words here. But when I left Chicken Run I felt right off that the movie had missed a chance to be an instant classic, and I have been pondering why. It certainly isn't the special effects. They were interesting, almost endearing in their three-dimensional reality vs. the pathetic ( in my opinion) Pokeman-level animation that seems to be in vogue today. It isn't the plot, which was cute and serious (deadly serious) at the same time. The chickens must escape or die. And the always dreaming Ginger keeps things moving with her constant attempts to escape and find someplace better for not just herself, but for the other chickens. So what felt empty? To me, it was the character of the chickens themselves. Now, chickens don't have much depth, I know. But these were movie characters! They should pop out, make you identify with them even if they are clay chickens! But only Ginger (and the effectively profit-hungry and evil Mrs. Tweedle) created a presence. The other chickens has a one-dimensional personality that quickly grew predictable and tiresome. For example, take the ""stupid chicken"" (I can't believe I am writing this). I forget her name ... Henrietta? She is always knitting and completely missing the point of anything. She never changed. Or take the old war veteran rooster. He is pompous and a bit lost and never changes, either. Even Rocky the rooster changed only in the most cliched of all ways ... coming back from his freedom to help Ginger and her pals escape. If any of these characters had shown some growth, it would have made for a better movie. It also could have used some funnier lines, though the general lack of pop culture jokes (oh sure, there were a few Star Trek lines) was a relief. One other thing stuck out rather jarringly at the end. Without giving the plot away, Ginger seems surprised that the retired war veteran rooster can't fly a plane. Uh, he is a rooster. Ginger seems perfectly aware that human society is a bird of a different feather (a-hem) and has never seen a rooster or chicken fly anything. She's too smart to be blind as to believe that roosters flew human planes. That seemed weird to me. Still, despite the predictable ending, Chicken Run was fun (well, the second half was much more lively than the first half; about 30 minutes into a 1:10 p.m. show my wife fell asleep) and so different than anything now out there. It also had a noble message about dreaming and improving ones life. Best of all, it wasn't Disney. For that reason alone, go see it.",0.875
8874,"The best English movie of the last 10 years; I confess I am a massive fan of Spaced so came at this with some high expectations that were not disappointed. I have to agree that this film is quintessentially English, like the Long Good Friday, The Ladykillers etc. and is none the worse for it. Unlike most other recent Brit comedies, it makes no attempt to internationalise its content, it also has a number of people with dead end jobs. Unlike all of the Richard Curtis films, which I love by the way, which tend to be populated with the landed classes, wealthy middle class professionals or eccentrics, this film has working class characters in suburbia. It is a perfect parody of Zombie films and also the occasional numbness of English existence.  I particularly enjoyed the inability of any of the characters to shoot straight in direct contrast to most Hollywood horrors where ""one shot stops"" seem to be the order of the day. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but it has one of the funniest scenes even screened, involving zombies and a record collection. It is a miracle that it got funding and was filmed.  This is exactly what the British film industry needs more of. PS Keep an eye out for those cameos!",0.0
4886,"Definitely one of the best  films of 2001!; This was a wonderful movie, with colourful characters, a fun storyline, and a funny and sometimes touching script.(I liked Shrek as well, but I slightly preferred this) I don't think it is quite as good as Toy Story, but I found it an enormously entertaining film, it was much better than I expected. The animation was truly excellent, with colourful and engaging backgrounds, and no stiff movements as far as I could see. I wasn't hugely keen on the song playing over the end credits, but compared to the overall goodness of the film, that is such a minor criticism, and it is fair to say that people have different tastes in music. The script was very, very funny, particularly with the character Roz. The voice talents were fantastic, John Goodman and Billy Crystal were brilliant as Sulley and Mike, Steve Buschemi clearly has a lot of seedy fun as Randall, Jennifer Tilly is wonderfully innocent as Mike's girlfriend, and the late James Coburn is wholly convincing as Waternoose. And I loved the character of Boo, she was so cute, and I loved the ending, people complained it was overly-sentimental but I thought it was so sweet. The story, as is always the case with Pixar films is highly original and charming, and doesn't drag at all. Overall, a wonderful film, truly entertaining and a must-see, and if you are starting to lose faith in Disney and their countless sequels, this is perfect for you. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox.",0.025
3751,"Feminists rejoice!; Chicken Run (2000) is a good film for kids.  A female figure, a hen named Ginger, is the heroine.  She organizes the hens in order to escape their prison.  The two male chickens are fibbers and not as helpful as they at first appear to be.  Ginger, however, manages to encourage them enough to make them useful.  The roosters do their part to help save the day, along with all the hens, but they don't take over the operation.  There are no princesses in this story, no helpless females awaiting a man's rescuing arms.  There is some romance, but it is egalitarian and modern.  No Victorian values here (George Lucas must hate this movie; in his version, the rooster would come in and single-handedly save the day).  This film boasts great stop-motion animation by Wallace and Gromit creator Nick Parks.  It is extremely funny and might just teach kids not only compassion for animals, but also that women can save the day.  Loosely based on The Great Escape (1963), this film is not a mish-mash of clichÃ©s and poorly written dialogue.  It is clever enough to entertain kids and their parents or babysitters.",0.875

5540,"A classic Harryhausen cheesfest; Clash of the Titans! A story of daring adventurers, on the spot romance and cheesy dialogue can be considered a classic but is very much flawed both for better and worse.The setting of Greek mythology opens up a gateway to a whole cast of ""epic"" stop-motion creatures which is Ray Harryhausen's specialty but if you've never tried stop-motion before it may be harder to appreciate his great work which is the best part of this film As for the films weaknesses, it has many. However my biggest complaint is just how dated it feels. It looks and sounds like a film from the 1960's, like another Hausen picture ""Jason and the Argonauts"". The characters are fairly 2-dimensional and the romance sub-plot is a bit confusing with just how silly it is but at the same time it works to the films advantage. Its silly but entertaining, sometimes you'll be laughing your arse off but in a good way. The film doesn't exactly take its self seriously. When it comes down to it the films at its best when there's monsters on the screen, especially one fight with a medusa which blew me away but I won't spoil it, but besides that its not particularly strong in the other categories. I give a strong recommendation nonetheless for just how entertaining it is. If you see it in a shop, don't hesitate to pick it up.",0.0
903,"Far greater than you might have expected!; Who says exposure of mystery or not is the key to distinguish Thriller and Mystery? In fact, I felt them both in this movie! As plot goes by, I discovered the truth with protagonist. Then at the end it caught my breath. I was wondering what he would do and what could possibly happen. I've been always unwilling to watch movies in old days, thinking they are old and might be unacceptable. To be specific, the cinematography is absolutely not as beautiful as today, and the edit is now like today's style Â— fast-pacing. So many times I chose to watch some ordinary ones in current age instead of some classic ones in old days. But that's so wrong! As time goes by and technology develops, what's left for the next generation would always be the best. Those average- quality ones would simply be replaced by the best. So for now, most of the movies would be regarded as trash maybe in hundreds of years later. Then why waste time watching them if I'm not enjoying them? So, only look for those movies which can make you enjoy - the fantastic story the movie tells - the way the director represents the story - the work of editor and cinematographer that makes it an art - the great performance of those actor and actress Back to this movie, the reasons I love it stated below. Its dialogue is designed so natural. I don't know whether it is just the style they talked in 50's or not. For me, overall, it looks natural. And the other thing is they keep connecting to the next topic they wanna talk about or the next plot that's gonna happen. And it is so fluent. Actress is so beautiful. I've always heard that in Hitchcock's movies, actress would always be beautiful blonds. Haven't got a chance to see that. We'll see. The editing and filming is actually far better than I expected, since you know it's a 1958 movie.. In a word, it is so great! And now I get to understand why people would talk about Hitchcock's movies a lot and regard him as one of the greatest directors in film history.",0.0

5816,"better than the first, they are fitting into there roles; I have so much to say. I just saw the movie three hours ago so it's still fresh in my mind. Okay first up the actor who portrays Harry. In the first movie I did not like him that much, and in my opinion he has improved so much from number one. The resemblance between him and the actual Harry potter fictional character, the one I see in my mind when I read the books is uncanny. Ron- number one I loved him. Actually he was my favourite of the kids, I thought he was adorable. Number two, he acts too scared, seems to be Harry's right hand man, listening to what he says. In the books he is funnier and much feistier. I still thought he was good, in number three i'm sure he will be better. He was soo funny though. i loved how he was the comic relief in the film hermoine- we did not see much of her compared to the others, so she did not annoy me. she seemed more serious and seemed to have a bit of an ego in the film, but that's not to say she wasn't good. she was better in this film by far, then again there was not that much of her so I haven't got that much to go on. she seemed to be more dramatic, and more emotional in this film. There are some parts that did annoy me, like in Diagon Ally she comes out of the shop, waits for half an hour runs to harry & hagrid waits another half hour then starts talking. and god forbid this, but are they trying to make hermione out to be sexier? the other children. all of them seemed more solemn, there was less laughter less smiles, and it seemed to me there was more egotism in the air. it seemed that everyone tried to act more serious and more dramatic than the others that the movie did not have that much of a comedic feel to it. draco in number one was sooooo much better than he is in number two. Oliver wood, we did not see that much of him so I could not judge on him that much. the young girl who plays guinny was wonderful. the snippets they had of her when tom was talking of how she opened the chamber, flushed the book down the toilet and so on, she was wonderful. her facial expressions were great. the adults again are a different story. we did not see snape in potions, so again we were deprived of the hatred between Harry and him. I still like mognagal in this film. dumbledoor I thought was wonderful in number one, but this movie he has changed. even hagrid seemed less funnier. the movie in general lacked consistency. what I mean by that it would jump from one scene to another. it seemed a bit distorted to me. and what the hell was with the ending. hermoine running to Harry. and then shaking Ron's hands. why? and then the corny mushy scene when hagrid comes, and he tells the three kids that he is very thankful towards them, and then everyone claps. i loved the part when harry spoke parseltounge, that was so well done. it was one of the highlights. the part when he stabs the snake jaw into the book and the ink spills everywhere was well done.

1246,"A great film; Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society is a masterpiece. It achieves showing an interesting story about certain prep school teenagers and the art of teaching. The film is sad but a great drama, and highly enjoyable. I found the performances very convincing and liked the direction of Peter Weir here. The screenplay was written very well, an emotionally charged film. Williams is his best here, its this role that helps shape another great performance of his in 98's Good Will Hunting. I liked this film a lot though, not even comparable to crap films like School Ties or even better than the recent powerful Swedish film Evil, which was brutally violent and got its point across but did not leave as great as impression as this film did, without the violence. A great film, deserves all the praise it receives. --- IMDb Rating: 7.7, my rating: 10/10",0.0
1246,"I don't think people really understand the film; I just finished with the movie and I personally think it was great. The characters were deep, especially Mr. Keating and Neal who I felt were quite similar to each other. They both try and rebel against people who oppose them and both fail in some way though Keating is still admired by most of the student's in his class. Neal shoots himself because of his father's continuous oppression, which I feel was not forced in the screenplay but rather beautifully planned. I felt it was quite predictable that he was going to kill himself and did not take the film out of focus but only brought more depth to it. Todd is shown to be meek and introvert for reasons unknown to the viewer but it is quite believable. I thought the film was very realistic and actually showed how students are sometimes forced to study subjects that they are not very interested in, and that parents like Neal's father and teachers like the principal of the school do exist. I can personally connect to the film as I too am a student of literature but I feel that many of the unhappy viewers are those who have no particular interest in literature and poetry. I think its a must watch and a beautifully directed film where the viewer WILL be affected emotionally in a good way and will definitely learn something from this film no matter what age group he/she belongs to.",0.0

The students of a private boys school return after the holidays to two new changes.A new student called Todd Anderson(Ethan Hawke) and the new English teacher with a different view of teaching Mr Keating(Robin Williams). As the year begins Mr Keating inspires the boys to be different from everyone else and follow their hearts. Keating finds his methods opposed by the schools strict headmaster Mr Nolan(Norman Lloyd). Some of his students reform a secret club which Keating started with some friends when he was a pupil at the school. The club is called The Dead Poets Society, the idea is to learn poetry and discuss life. Tragedy lies in store when one pupil Neil Perry(Robert Sean Leonard)goes against his domineering father(Kurtwood Smith)and his plans for his future and tries to do what he wants to do. Williams is excellent as the outgoing and kind Keating desperately trying to make learning fun and interesting. He cares about the students a great deal and wants the best for them. Williams shines during the comedy scenes but shows what a good dramatic actor he could be too. Robert Sean Leonard gives a deeply moving performance as Neil, so desperately wanting to be his own man and do what he wants but unable to stand up against his father. There's fine support from Gale Hanson as the rebel Charlie Dalton and Josh Charles as Knox Overstreet, two of Neil's closest friends. Funny and poignant, Dead Poets Society is a film that stays with you long after it's over. Robin Williams gives one of his best performances proving he could perform serious dramatic moments as well as comic ones.",0.0
50005,"Gilded walls, delusion; All the other comments point out the visual exuberance of this. Indeed the Tang palace shown here would make the Versailles look boorish. The film is a feast, a hot shower of melted color and gold. Walls are gilded, pillars are fire colored, ceilings are purple. Every frame an ornate sculpture. You can see why Zhang would be picked for the Olympic ceremony two years later - the festival at the end is like a trial run. But now to see the makings of things clearly instead of being dazzled. It's precisely a dynastic beauty that overpowers the eye, clouds the mind with visual smoke. Gold here is both opulence and delusion, beauty and ignorance, not unconnected these two. Within this gilded cage unfolds Shakespearean drama with tragic irony in abundance between emperor, wife and three sons. The idea, deeply Chinese, is that there's heavenly order in the world and man must take his place in it and devise his own order to mirror the higher one. The Chinese had indeed mulled over this long and hard to devise their own order that would support an empire. We see everything ordered here and the small rituals involved. Elaborate preparations are underway for a festival that celebrates the unity of heaven and man. But the medicine she's ritually made to take every day (to ""balance her energies"") is poisoned; an indictment of the artificial harmony favored so much by the Chinese. It is a household that we enter essentially. Scaled down from imperial machinations that involve poison and succession to the throne, we see an unhappy family. When the imperial doctor who has been administering the poison with his daughter is felled upon by mysterious figures in black in a most marvelous scene outdoors, these are apparitions of guilt that have come to haunt, puppets on strings descending from the sky. It's karma, another kind of heavenly order. Something went wrong once in this family and the world makes it wash up in front of them. I like that it's all abstracted within walls here, that we don't venture outside for sweeping history. It has elaborate action only near the end and using the same gilded abstraction. And that it builds the same order for itself around a household essentially and karmas set in motion. The ending is ruinous of course. All because a man took a wife out of convenience one day.",0.0

There is also that stubborn British courage in times of trouble.

903,"Another masterpiece from the Master; ""Only one is a wanderer; two together are always going somewhere."" Hitchcock's Vertigo is considered by many critics as the best film ever, although this wasn't always the case considering that when it was released in 1958 it was poorly received by audiences and critics alike. So much so that it marked the last time that Hitchcock worked with James Stewart who he blamed for not attracting audiences any more due to his age. Unfortunately it was the last collaboration between the two, but they left us a rich legacy. Hitchcock also blamed Kim Novak's performance, but if he were alive today he would realize what a mistake those two claims were. First of all, I believe Kim Novak was enchanting in this film, she was the perfect femme fatale in this sort of film noir suspense thriller. She was attractive and hard to decipher. James Stweart was also great and once again is believable as this obsessed man who is following this mysterious women all over San Francisco. His fear of heights, which is a key part of this film, is also believable and thanks to Hitchcok's technique (now known as the Vertigo shot) those scenes worked extremely well. However, the best thing about Vertigo is the strange twists it takes and how it surprises us with the direction it takes half way through the film. It is hard to classify this film and it goes places you never imagine. This is what Hitchcock does best in his films and that is why he is considered as the Master of Suspense. The psychological elements are always present and everything is so masterfully crafted in this film that it is hard to break out of the enchanted atmosphere created here. The film's theme of obsession is probably why it is called a masterpiece considering no other film has explored this subject as well as Vertigo does. I personally prefer Rear Window, another collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock, as his masterpiece although that film is more generic and easier to classify. In Rear Window Hitchcock explores voyeurism, in Vertigo a man's obsession over a mysterious woman who he feels attracted to. Actually there are two women who Stewart's character relates to in this film. Other than Madeleine (Kim Novak) who is the woman he is assigned to follow around the city he also shares a close friendship with Midge (played by Barbara Bel Geddes) his former love interest from his college days. Midge is an intelligent women and the perfect one for Scottie (James Stewart), but as he becomes more and more obsessed with Madeleine she begins to be sidelined. The only issue I had with this film involved some of the dialogue scenes between Scottie and Midge during the beginning of the film which served to set up the story and their background. It never felt authentic but it accomplished its purpose. Once Kim Novak enters in the picture and the theme of obsession kicks in the film really picks up and seduces the audience into its mysterious and eerie atmosphere. It's unpredictable, but I wouldn't say this thriller is as scary as Psycho, another Hitchcock film I would rank above Vertigo. I really loved this film despite some pacing issues during the beginning and midway through the story, but other than that I agree with the claims that this is a masterpiece and a must see for film lovers everywhere. Just like Citizen Kane this is a film that was ahead of its time and one who the contemporary audience wasn't ready to embrace.",0.0
4326,"A very good movie; Contains Spoilers Mississippi Burning is a riveting dramatization of the real-life investigation into the disappearance of three 1960's civil rights workers in rural Mississippi. Despite being criticized by many for sticking pretty close to fact. Movie-a- Day.com blasts it for telling the story from a white perspective instead of a black perspective.  I feel that the accuracy of the dramatization is of the utmost importance; ""perspective"" is irrelevant.  Despite that, Mississippi Burning remains one of the most poignant, yet underrated films dealing with racism and justice in 1960's southern America, certainly on par with 1967's In the Heat of the Night. The northern-born, by-the-book FBI agent Ward (Willem Dafoe) is partnered with Agent Anderson (Gene Hackman,) a former small town Alabama sheriff to find them, but meet with resistance from Mayor Tilman (R. Lee Ermey) and Sheriff Ray Stuckey (Gailard Sartain) and an unsympathetic cast of police officers and townspeople, many of whose members are also members of the Ku Klux Klan. You can cut the tension between Anderson and Ward with a knife, but when his methods of getting to the truth fail, Ward is forced to cede to the older, wiser Anderson.  Through fostering a genuinely friendly relationship with the wife of a vicious Deputy Clinton Pell (played very convincingly by Frances McDormand and Brad Dourif respectively,) Anderson is able to learn that the civil rights workers were killed and buried in a nearby quarry.  When Mrs. Pell is assaulted by her husband at the behest of his Klan buddy Frank Bailey (played by the always dependable Michael Rooker,) to keep her quiet, Anderson wreaks havoc on those he knows are responsible. Stephen Tobolowsky also has a small, but impressive role as Clayton Townley. The end of the film sees most of the defendants found guilty and sentenced to various prison sentences.

As well as being the shortest feature at just 22 minutes, this W/G adventure is also the earliest and it kinda shows. The plasticine animation is a little creaky and funny here, sort of reminiscent of the Mork animation about the little man in the box. Admirable though the craftsmanship behind it is, I've never actually been hugely into Wallace & Gromit (maybe a bit too clean and traditional for someone of my generation.) The only one I've really enjoyed is The Wrong Trousers (and that was more from when I was younger and less aware of, shall we say, the seedier pleasures of life.) I was driven to actively seek out this early effort due to the resurgence in popularity as a result of the hugely successful recent film adaptation.

5816,"there isn't secrets: it's Colombus + Williams + Harris; This is for me the best of the series and it goes as well for the book, the game and the movie. It's the quintessential Potter spirit because it has all the goof things I look for: the school year, the wizardry, the friendship and the mystery. I remember the first time I saw it: it was during a Wednesday baby-sitting of the son of a good friend: He was 6 then and we kept playing the scene when the Spider comes up at the car's window. It's true that the production is less baroque (cheaper?) than the later movies but at last, the young trio is still well coached and the visual stays very realistic even if it's about an imaginary universe. If Hermione takes a health leave, Ginny makes a brilliant substitute and it's funny to see that she has always been this same quiet, shy girl. But this movie counts for me because it's the last of the real Dumbledore. Richard Harris was the perfect choice: his weary voice (a bit like Pacino) and his aura makes him a very warm grandfather and a respected headmaster. Gambon never gets into the robe and it's a pity that Mr. Harris couldn't follow the adventure.",0.0
4388,"What a waste; I just got back from viewing what is arguably one of the biggest disappointments of the year. Don't get me wrong--I was a huge fan of the original installment. The parodies of pop culture movies and its ""we don't take ourselves seriously"" atmosphere were a welcome change and struck with great results. The sequel, although it admirably attempts to separate itself from the first one, would've been better off sticking with the old formula. First off, the new characters were incredibly mundane and unentertaining. Tori Spelling's role as a ditz was terrible. Getting it on with a ghost was absolutely pathetic. Some of the bathroom humor which is something I normally don't mind, was used to such extremes that the first 5 minutes of the movie ruined any chance of it getting off the ground. The rest feels so rushed, and it seems that no thought was put into the script. The writers tried to create some new material rather than making fun of current movies(I won't spoil the ""story"" for ya), but everything sounded insanely immature and insulting. Throwing ideas in a hat and randomly picking one was the name of the game here and it got ugly. Speaking of parodies, the few redeeming parts, such as the Nike basketball commercial rip-off and the scenes with the parrot were sufficient to prevent this film from making an all-time worst movie list, but that's hardly a compliment. Curiosity is going to get the best of many, but I'm giving it my highest recommendation to avoid at all costs.",0.0
6773,"Well done, funny cartoon with heart.;  I love it when I get to review a well done, creative film. It is a seldom occurance. In the case of ""The Triplets of Belleville"" I will write about a wonderful, heartwarming, funny movie. The story revolves around a mother and son who live in a single dwelling in Paris. The mother loves him very much. The son becomes a competator in the Tour De France. During the race, he gets kidnapped by some gambling ring. The plot then starts to develop. The mother follows the kidnappers, with the help of her dog, to the seaside city of Belleville. In Belleville, she and the dog are invited to stay with the Triplets of Belleville, a group of Burlesque performers. There are alot of impressive parts of this film. The scene at Tour De France, where the son is kidnapped, is visually captivating. The scene in which the mother and dog are at sea, folowing the massive ship that holds the kidnappers, is beautiful. The scene which introduces the kidnappers is hilarious. The scene which shows the mother and dog joining the Triplets for a meal is both disturbing and poignant. The scene where we find out why the son was kidnapped is stunning. And, I have to mention the final climax. It is the best few minutes of the film. From the beginning until the final frame, it is exciting and marvolous. I wish I knew the name of the writer and director, so I could give him some well deserved credit. I know that he is French-Canadian. And, I know that he received a Acadamy Award nomination for best animated film. I send him congradulations on a great achievement. This is one amazing film.

8874,"A comedy you can take a bite out of; 'Shaun of the Dead', directed by Edgar Wright presents us the tale of Shaun (Simon Pegg, who also co-wrote the script) who is an Average Joe, living in London who has your normal, run of the mill problems. He has an unsatisfying job, girlfriend troubles, no one gets along with his best friend Ed (the hilarious Nick Frost) and zombies are hunting him. He not only has to try to survive the day being surrounded by them, but has to protect his friends and some of his family while trying to defeat the living dead. For a guy who is very content to live his life in a rut, this proves to be quite a challenge. Luckily the jokes in 'Shaun of the Dead' are a hell of a lot funnier than my summary line for this review. I cannot remember the last time I laughed so hard and so much at a film that didn't have anything to do with the Coen brothers. Not only is the humor in 'Shaun of the Dead' about as dark as it gets, but there are such witty moments that I was left shaking my head at the brilliance of the script. There are several moments where the humor is subtle, yet uproariously funny. A good example is when Shaun wakes up the morning the zombies have taken over, and, incredibly hung over, walks in a daze to the corner convenience store, he doesn't notice that there are huge bloody hand prints on the cooler doorÂ… then suddenly slips on something the audience doesn't see, but assumes is some kind of blood or gore. This could have gone two other ways Â– either he wouldn't slip at all, or we would see what he slips on, but the way it was presented made it one of the many times I found myself crying from laughing so hard. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are also absolutely brilliant as best friends and our main protagonists. Their fantastic and natural acting, coupled with the 'real' feel of the dialogue made for some truly standout performances. I am not familiar with either actor, but if they are not already stars, this is surely their breakout film. The only criticism I have of the film is something that I may have even missed with all of my laughter Â– I have no idea why there was this sudden plague of the living dead. For a film as entertaining as this one, however, that kind of explanation is something that really isn't necessary; something that I am normally a stickler for. There were also some unexpected poignant moments that seemed out of place, but none of these criticisms diminished the overall effect the film had on me. I so thoroughly enjoyed this film that it is disappointing to say that this is not a film for everyone. Make no mistake, 'Shaun of the Dead' is at times extremely violent and quite gory, and it's blackest of black humor is not going to appeal to many, but if you want to see a brilliant comedy that is going to make you cringe while making you laugh out loud, this is your movie. I haven't had this much fun at the movies in a long time. --Shelly",0.0
66097,"Everything About this Movie is Great; Coraline follows a little girl who, after moving into a new house, realizes how boring her life is. She eventually discovers a secret door that leads her to an alternate dimension where everything is better, yet as she goes there more and more she begins to receive warnings against the place. This was one of those movies where I hit the thirty minute mark and had basically solidified a 10/10. To start the visuals are great. This is a clay-mation movie though, so it's kind of expected, but there were still loads of great big visual spectacles scattered throughout. Not only that, but every character design is great. From Coraline herself to Wybie to Beldam (especially Beldam), everyone looks fantastic. The plot is, while not horribly original, presented in the best way. It's complemented by interesting and fun characters who lead it along, one of whom is a little girl who is actually smarter than most of the grown women we see in other horror movies these days, yet she's not so smart that she's unrealistic. The movie actually isn't all that scary, but instead takes it's time in building up the characters and conflict until the climax where I felt more tension than I did fear. Sure, I figured I knew the ending considering it's supposed to be a kid's movie, but that didn't stop me from getting invested. It was scary more through subtlety and knowing things that maybe the characters didn't, or not knowing things that the characters also didn't. The main villain, however, was very intimidating and creepy especially towards the end. Surprisingly, the opening sequence also managed to be pretty unsettling. I was surprised to find that the soundtrack was actually really good. It fit the movie really well and I just liked how it sounded. I've listened to it outside of the movie and still really like it. Overall Coraline was fantastic. Everything about this movie is exceptional, so I really don't see any reason why I'd give it anything less than a 10/10. I can certainly see why someone wouldn't enjoy it as much as I did, but I don't really care. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.",0.0
903,"Hitchcock's most haunting film; Vertigo is directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is based on the novel by Pierre Boulle, has a beautiful score by Bernard Herrmann and stars James Stewart, Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes. A haunting and suspenseful story that is one of Hitchcock's best if not his all time best film.Vertigo surprisingly didn't do very well on it's initial release and wasn't well liked.However over time it's become a massive success both with critics and audiences and is a truly stunning piece of work. Detective Scottie Ferguson(James Stewart)is hired to follow an old friends wife Madeleine(Kim Novak). She is apparently being possessed by the spirit of a dead ancestor who killed herself. As he begins to do some research into Madeleine's past and sees more of her, he is caught up in a very weird situation. The film becomes quite creepy in a disturbing way as he becomes obsessed with Madeleine and later with a woman who looks like Madeleine called Judy(Kim Novak in a stunning duel performance.) Part ghost story and part love story this is one of Hitchcocks greatest films, a combination of genres and featuring a great cast and lots of suspense and tension. James Stewart gives one of his best performances and is excellent as the emotionally tortured Scottie. Vertigo also features some gorgeous location footage of the city of San Fransisco.This is a must see film.",0.0

903,"haunting, melancholic piece about obsession; There are some negative comments evident in IMDB.  Despite the truly shameful naivety of some of them - are interesting to read, with the majority them highlighting some valid, albeit subjective, points. First and foremost, those not particular in tune with films pre-dating the 60s will perhaps find some of the situations and dialogue clunky.  I did, but like anything you merely have to become accustomed to it. Although the film may seem long and slow to some, I did not encounter such problems.  Rather, the dreamlike mood induced a hauntingly, melancholic, almost trance-like state for this viewer.  This I think is Vertigo's timeless appeal.  While Rear Window is arguably the better film, and enjoys greater technical direction, tighter story telling and pacing (as well as a wittier interplay between the two main leads), Vertigo delves into the subconcious and weaves its own unique spell on the viewer as we follow Scotty into obsession. Vertigo 'feels' like Mr Hitchcock's most personal film.  However I do think certain, curious individuals are reading too much into the piece, purely as an insight into Mr Hitchcocks character, particularly his fascination for (certain) blondes.  As Mr Hitchcock and his daughter will often attest, he was always concerned merely with cinema art as entertainment - and, that entertainment was always a figment of his imagination.

He starts off as a light-hearted, good natured guy and becomes very manipulative, very single-minded, very scary, very un-Stewart-like. And yet, even as he's leading the woman he thought he was in love with up the stairs in an emotionally manic frenzy, Scotty's still a completely sympathetic character. He's manhandling Judy, screaming at her, and at that moment you can really *feel* that his heart has been ripped from chest. You don't want Judy to come to harm, but you can't begrudge Scotty his rage either. Whatever happens, you know there can be no happy ending. And as Scotty stands in the bell tower looking down at his lover's corpse for the second time, you and he are utterly crushed. Now *that's* cinema.",0.0

5816,"A Disapointment; *** Contains some spoilers*** When making a film about children, its best to let children act the parts, and in the first Harry Potter film, the child actors were perfect for their roles. Unfortunatly the producers waited a little too long before making the second one and so all of the kids now look and sound a lot older than the characters they are suppose to be playing and most of them now suck at their roles anyways. While i think that the adult actors filled their roles well, the new characters have almost NO development besides a slightly brooding musical tone when they appear. Another point against it is that script was very cheesy you cant get a grip on whats really happening until the end when everything is explained in a good minute! It would have been a lot better if there was more subelty to this film instead of the blantent actions of the characters.  I will say that the special effects are quite good but cannot save it.

6773,"Very unusual and clever but also not particularly pleasant viewing; When I saw this film, I really wanted to love it. After all, I adore French films as well as animation so I really thought I'd found an excellent film for me. At first, I was quite happy, as the animation style and quality were very nice. I particularly liked the quirky way that people were drawn as well as the nice muted colors. There was also a funny and odd sensibility about the film that made me smile....for a while. Then, I noticed that unfortunately the film never really achieved anything. It just went on and on with practically no dialog (which is fine) and a story that just seemed to drag (which isn't so fine). In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the film seemed very happy at its own cleverness and never really tried to come up with an interesting story or one you could show to children. In fact, the film is exceptionally dark and rather cruel at times--with a plot that late in the film resembles the brilliant independent film, 13 TZAMETI. However, 13 TZAMETI is a film no child would watch nor would any sane parent let them watch this ultra-dark film--while unsuspecting parents might naturally assume that since THE TRIPLETS is a cartoon that it's a kids' movie. Despite a few clever touches here and there, this is certainly not a kids film. Nor, now that I think about it, is THE TRIPLETS a film for even the average viewer. Dark, quirky and with a plot that, at times, is practically non-existent, I just couldn't get into this film and found myself amazingly bored.

3751,"finger-lickin' good; Chickens. Lots and lots of chickens.  Chickens from England, walking, running, and knitting.  There's something really funny about British claymation characters, something that the creators of `Wallace and Grommit' have known for quite some time.  `Chicken Run', their first full-length animated feature, brings together elements of `The Great Escape', `101 Dalmatians', and even some `Star Trek' to create a hilarious, smart, vegetarian conscious movie. The crisis: the chickens are prisoners at a farm where unproductive hens are turned into dinner and even the prolific ones are treated like egg-laying slaves.  The farm's evil owner then has a moment of fiendish clarity and realizes that gathering and selling eggs is boring.  Making chicken pot pies would be much more profitable and probably a heck of a lot more fun, so she buys a pie machine.  Well, you can't make pot pies without breakin' a few chickens, but since they're so cute--well, as cute as British chickens can be--we don't want them to die!  We want them to run and fly outta there!  Wait--chickens can't flyÂ… or can they? They answer is - no, of course chickens can't fly, sorry to disappoint you.  But they can sure try, and try they do.  This becomes one of the most entertaining parts of the whole film, as most training montages tend to be.  With the help of a flying rooster (voice of Mel Gibson), and the leadership of funky chicken Ginger (the daughter from TV show `Absolutely Fabulous'), the ladies try everything from leaping off rooftops to being flung in giant slingshots, all with hilariously unsuccessful results. Meanwhile, the evil farmer becomes all that much closer to completing her pot pie contraption, and the chickens still don't know how to fly. Before they can escape they'll have to face the facts and realize that to get out they'll have to use their brains instead of their funny-looking wings.  Each chicken has a special skill, from knitting (the fat, naive chicken) to engineering (the Scottish one with bad vision) that will have to work together to get them out. Boy, the theme sounds corny, but it definitely works in this film. `Chicken Run' teaches that although we can't fly, we have the right to say `Buwaaauck!' and eat corn off the ground as free fowl, without worry of laying eggs or becoming pot pies.  Besides that, those little faces are enough to keep you entertained and wondering just how much patience someone must have to animate a film like this. My grade for `Chicken Run': A ",0.875

The main reason behind its entertainment value are, not for the first time, Ray Harryhausen's special effects. Mr. Harryhausen, who died last month aged 92, has turned many a movie which would have been pretty dull without him, into something extremely watchable. His army of admirers include James Cameron, Steven Spielberg & countless others many of whom were inspired as boys watching his special effects wizardry to become film directors. The acting of some of the films main characters such as Harry Hamlin who plays Perseus is wooden, Laurence Olivier as Zeus is over-the-top, Judi Bowker as Andromeda is forgettable & Ursula Andress playing the love goddess Aphrodite just looks bored out of her brains.

6773,"If you're looking for wildly original animation then this movie is for you; In recent years there has been a boom (probably thanks to globalization) in the release of foreign animated films outside the common market (read Disney,Dreamworks, Japanese anime), mainly European emerging as alternatives for those seeking animation not made for little children. Within this wave comes the french movie The Triplets of Belleville, one of the most original animated films ever made (in the opinion of this writer, of course). Directed by Sylvain Chomet tells the story of Madame Souza who is in charge of raising her grandson Champion after being orphaned. In search of something that makes him happy, she discovers that Champion's true vocation is cycling and after years of hard training is ready to compete in the famous Tour de France. But in the middle of the competition he is kidnapped by a mafia that uses cyclists for clandestine betting and they're killed if they lose. Thus, Madame Souza begins the rescue of her grandson in the bizarre town of Belleville with the help of the triplets of Belleville, famous stars of music hall in the 20's. This is how Chomet creates an amazing story full of absurdities and nonsensical situations that works wonderfully and without the need of dialog creates absolute empathy to characters that appear to be designed to cause annoyance. A very curious element is Chomet's decision to portray Belleville (an obvious reference to the city of New York) as a city full of obese people. Although this is meant as a critique of Western society where consumption makes people apathetic and uninterested in themselves. Moreover, the music plays an important role in this film, without being a musical in the strict sense of the word has incredibly vivid and infectious musical moments, like the opening scene which recalls the glory years of the triplets and in the making small appearances of legends like Django Reinhardt, Josephine Baker and Fred Astaire, in addition the soundtrack composed by Benoit Charest adds a feeling of nostalgia.

5816,"The good's good, the bad's bad; WARNING: Possible spoilers towards the end Not since Blair Witch II has there been a film in which the acting and directing was so sorely lacking. Chris Columbus seems to have a career littered with mediocre movies - Home Alone, Home Alone II, Bicentennial Man. That Bicentennial Man was such a mangled version of Isaac Asimov's novel might suggest that he cannot properly translate books to films; Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was mostly saved by the talents of seasoned actors such as Robbie Coltrane (the lumbering Hagrid), Richard Griffiths (the detestable uncle Vernon), Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, John Cleese and the outstanding Alan Rickman. The casting for these parts was beyond reproach (except Richard Harris, not the perfect dumbledore in my opinion -- however he delivered a sterling performance anyway). Although the actors and actresses reprised their roles flawlessly (Miriam Margolyes in particular delivered an excellent, though short, performance), this was not enough to redeem this film in light of the dull, monotonous acting by Emma Watson as Hermione (there were points in this film where one could really feel her reaming off the lines from the script, not putting feeling into her performance). Daniel Radcliffe's performance was better, but by no means up to the standard one would expect. When I watched Sorcerer's Stone I wondered about the casting of Rupert Grint as Ron. This film made my mind up. He looks the part, but as soon as he opens his mouth he is wrong. In some of the more ""frightening"" scenes of the film he was squealing like a suckling pig - these destroyed any atmosphere Columbus had managed to scrape together. There's something about hearing the missing link between a piglet and a human in Dolby 6.1 Surround Sound that distresses me. While on the issue of the sound, I think it was very overdone -- in the Quidditch match, for instance, when the bludger is following harry, the sound of it crashing through things sounded more like a cannon being fired than some wood being broken); in the scenes with the giant spiders (where a silent padding sound would have built more atmosphere) the sound was more like spiders wearing steel clogs walking across glass. Either that or they were chopsticks on legs. While talking about the sound, the (presumably computer generated) fire in the torches on the outside of Hogwarts at the end just didn't feel real -- more like silk being blown in a stream of air. This film, for all its failings, isn't the worst film you could waste your time watching (xXx comes to mind...). If you read the book and had a vivid picture of what things should be like I'd really advise against it, though. If you haven't read the book, the quality of the good acting is really good (although, conversely, the bad acting is REALLY bad), so if you can bear it, you'll be rewarded by the performances of Miriam Margolyes, Alan Rickman and others. Unfortunately, Richard Griffiths (uncle Vernon) just doesn't have enough to work with in order to give as good a performance as he did in the previous film.",0.0
5540,"Perseus rides Pegasus; Anyone under 30 need not rush to see this original for comparison purposes with the 2010 remake. It was master animator Ray Harryhausen's last film and a far cry from his glory days (JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS and SINBAD being prime examples). Nevereless, TITANS is fun for the most part. A very young Harry Hamlin as Perseus is on a quest to rescue his beloved Andromeda (played by a very pretty Judy Bowker). Perseus must subdue Pegasus, defeat Medusa (easily the best scene in the movie), fight the Kraken, a very large sea monster, and deal with a deformed villain who throws many obstacles in our hero's path. Harryhausen's animation cannot be faulted, but scenes that involve live actors who are also portrayed in part as animated characters abruptly take us out of the fantasy. Of course, this was long before the smooth CGI of today. A mechanical owl is cute, but clearly was intended to be Perseus' R2D2. Worth a watch mainly for film historians and completists.

5816,"Two Towers has some worthy competition; Warning: Minor Spoilers This movie rocked!  I knew that it had to be better than the first one, but this totally blew me away!  The script was great, and the acting from the children and adults alike was so much better than it was last time.  Not to mention the cool spiders, mandrakes, phoenix and the basilisk.  My friends and I were screaming during the scene when Harry and Ron wander into the Dark Forest to meet with Aragog.  That was truly scary.  Knockturn Alley was just as creepy as I imagined it from the book.   The new characters were just hysterical and frightening.  Kenneth Branagh definitely Gilderoy Lockhart beyond well, and you could see how much fun he must have had playing that part.  Same goes for Lucius.  Gees Jason Isaacs was scary.  Even I, being a villain freak that I am, cringed when he started beating Dobby with his cane.  Dobby was, by the way, not as annoying as one might have pictured him to be.  I guess the director was really trying to not make him that way after seeing what happened to George Lucas' reputation with Jar Jar Binks.  And Christian Coulson as Tom Riddle did the best by portraying a sixteen-year-old as evil.   However, there were a few things that the movie should have included: the scene where the Malfoys are selling things to Mr. Borgin and the Valentine's Day celebration.  Those would have been icing on the cake.  But when Lucius and Arthur are at Flourish and Blott's, they did not fight!  My friends and I were literally yelling FIGHT FIGHT, but they did not!  The movie also made Draco Malfoy seem more pitiful than bratty.  Not only is he treated rotten by his dad, but Snape isn't that nice to him either.   All in all, it was excellent.  I give it 9.5/10.  Cannot wait until Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire.",0.0
5816,"Very nice addition to the series; Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a somewhat restrained film, as Christopher Columbus makes the darker book seem much more childish than it is. Granted, the main characters are 12 years old, but it was way too light hearted. It's Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts, and trouble seems to be brewing again. Harry is hearing voices in the walls, voices that he thinks are connected to strange happenings around the school. Meanwhile, the teachers are equally puzzled. The second Potter boasts stronger acting than before, as the lead actor Daniel Radcliffe grows in talent (and in size). He once again portrays Harry well, and continues this trend in the later sequels. Rupert Grint is the best of the trio with his knack for comedy. He offers some of the best lines in the film, but this is short lived because he gets some of the worst in movie 3 and 4. The adult actors are always in fine form. Richard Harris gives a warm and fatherly performance as Albus Dumbledore, something his successor, Michael Gambon, lacks. Alan Rickman is mysterious again even though his character was proved to be good in the first film. The standouts are Ken Branaugh and Christian Coulson as Gilderoy Lockhart and Tom Riddle respectively. Branaugh captures the essence of the character very well, making it one of the most accurate performances in any of the movies, and given his past, it's no surprise. Definitely the best part of the movie. Coulson also gives a great performance, but unfortunately telling you would be spoiling the ending (although half the world has either seen this or read the book or knows the truth about Tom Riddle). The other actors (Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Jason Isaacs, and Julie Walters) all give fine performances as well. The film is very restrained in its writing and directing. The script is the most accurate translation of the books, but there are moments where it gets slow. The climax, however, comes out of nowhere and moves along fast, which is one good thing that Steve Kloves does. The film is also an action/adventure breed, and it fits the bill this time around. The quidditch scenes are back and better than ever, although one scene contains the most obvious example of how fast the kids are growing (Tom Felton's voice changes drastically throughout the film). All in all, CoS is a fine movie for the average moviegoer, but the book lovers will find that it is a rather restrained and toned down version of the book. Due to some violence, especially the potentially scary climax (giant snake, anyone?), HPCoS might scare a viewer under age 10. 8/10 --spy",0.0
50005,"A stunningly beautiful, but flawed masterpiece; Directed and written by: Zhang Yimou / Based on a story by: Cao Yu / U.S. Release: December 2006 / Viewed: January 14, 2007 ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" has to rank as one of the most visually stunning and lavish films ever made. A costume epic set in 10th Century China during the Tang Dynasty, it tells a story of royal family secrets revealed, for better or worse. This film now stands as the most expensive film ever made in China. The attention to detail, production design, cinematography, costumes and visual effects are outstanding. Visually, this film is a knockout, unfortunately, there is a problem with the storytelling. There is a lack of development of the main and central supporting characters of the film. The overall acting is good, but the characters are limited by the film's screenplay. We immediately delve into the story of the royal family, knowing little or nothing about the main and central supporting characters. There is secret plotting going on and the empress appears to be the victim of the emperor's scheme. Secrets are eventually revealed in the film's disappointing ending. If only there was more attention to story details (a better script), this film would rank as a cinematic masterpiece. As a film enthusiast, it'a little sad to see so much money and talent lavished on a film, being a wasted on an unsatisfying and unemotional story. Former cinematographer, Zhang Yimou is clearly a visually talented film director. He is not yet ready to be the sole screenwriter for one of his own films. By writing the screenplay to this film, he has spoiled this otherwise magnificent film of his. I hope he will team up with the two screenwriters for ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"" again.",0.0
903,"The drama of an opera. Wide screen  restored VHS version, with documentary.; VERTIGO First viewing, and I wasn't disappointed. The wide screen VHS release restored original color and music, and a documentary gave insight into the film's creation and restoration. The original trailer, complete with overdone narration, is more dated by far than the film. A note of obsession was sustained throughout with the extraordinarily dramatic Bernard Hermann score, moody cinematography, and settings which supposedly sparked the idea for the film in Hitchcock's mind. The convoluted plot caught me off guard, as a mystery should. One flaw might be over-long scenes of Jimmy Stewart driving, although the music made them purposeful. Stewart and Barbara Bel Geddes were perfect, and Kim Novack outdid herself in dual roles. The imaginative title sequence is also worth noting. Somehow the film made me think of opera.",0.0
4886,"Its heart outshines its technical achievements... as it should; ""Monsters, Inc"" is essentially about embracing your fears, and learning to laugh at them. A very timely message, don't you think? It's true that the little girl is absolutely adorable (but not saccharine), but the heart of the film is the growing relationship between Sully (big furry blue monster, voice by John Goodman) and this pre-verbal little girl he calls ""Boo."" At first, she's sort of a pet that he's apprehensive about. Predictably, she becomes much, much more to him. Sully learns to be a father. This movie made me cry. And laugh. It does have some lagging moments, and isn't quite on par with ""A Bug's Life"" or ""Toy Story 2,"" but it's darned good. (I've never been a big fan of the original ""Toy Story,"" which seemed more concerned with  ""gee-whiz-look-what-we-can-do-with-computers,"" rather than story and character, at which the subsequent Pixar films have excelled.) Technically, it's years ahead of ""Shrek,"" which, in my opinion, offered nothing beyond lifelike-looking characters (who nevertheless do not move in a lifelike fashion) and a dash of hip cynicism. Watch this movie and notice that the characters move in a completely convincing way, that fur and hair behave as they do in life, but that the movie does not call attention to it.

I will say, some scenes because the violence was very intense to the maximum, were rather upsetting to watch, like any scene when someone was attacked, the nature of the violence was very upsetting. The gunshot at the beginning was unbelievably loud, and made me jump quite violently. However, it is a very powerful and tense film, helped by a well-written script and an atmospheric music score. The dark brooding cinematography helped considerably to the film's proceedings, and the performances were excellent, with Gene Hackman mesmerising in the lead, and Willem Dafoe perfectly matching him. The story is a powerful one, and rarely slips in tension. Overall, a very tense and powerful film, long and quite violent, but a very good film, all the same. 8/10 Bethany Cox",0.0
8874,"Christmas turkey; Having consumed Our 2nd jar of Quality Street this festive season, my girlfriend and I decided to venture out to the pictures to enjoy what promised to be a movie with a difference - Shaun of the dead - which spoke boldly of being a romantic comedy.......with zombies. Sadly,this title is somewhat misleading inasmuch as there is little,if any,discernible romance,no comedy value of any description,and the implication that there may be some ""horror"" content is surely just a comment on the witless plot,wooden acting and utter pointlessness of this whole sorry debacle. This film, has, I'm afraid, got as much going for it as Simon Pegg's previous masterpiece,The Parole Officer,and will sink without trace only to be found in Blockbuster's bargain bin 6 months or so from now.

4886,"Charming Pixar; Monsters, Inc. (2005) *** (out of 4) Fun Pixar film about a company that operates by having monsters go into the rooms of children, scare them and then capture their screams. Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sully (John Goodman) accidentally bring one of the children back to Monstropolis and must find a way to get her back. This was another pleasant film from the company that seems to release one winner after another. As usual, there are many gags coming out of just about every place possible with many of them aimed at children but a lot of others are aimed at parents. You have to give a film a lot of credit when it can entertain adults just as much as children. I enjoyed the fact that the movie wants to make kids believe there are monsters in the closet and that they come out when the lights go off. For an animated movie to start with this premise and then work around to where the kids won't be scared is a pretty good little trick and it works wonderfully well. Crystal and Goodman do a terrific job with their vocal work and they make for a great duo. Apparently a lot of their dialogue was recorded with the actors together and this comes across as they seem very fresh and work extremely well off one another. Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi and James Coburn all turn in fine work as well. As expected, the animation is top-notch and looks incredibly good and especially the fur on Sully. I'm not sure what it was but his fur color and the way it moved just kept getting my attention.",0.025
8874,"Over-hyped, exacerbated by undeserved cult status; Don't get me wrong: this film is alright. But it is far from brilliant, and I have no idea how it picked up its hype and high-star ratings. It's a nice comedy, but making the IMDb top 250?! please... Shaun of the dead is similar to most zombie movies you've probably seen before, with the twist of being more of a comedy/spoof and less of fright/horror/gore movie. And while it does get some laughs out, it never reaches drop-dead funny. Cult classic? only if you consider any Zombie flick an automatic cult classic. Zombie films are a popular genre. So popular, in fact, that the multitude of Zombie films out there could be cataloged into sub-genres.

1175,"In Paris, everyone can hear you scream... but that's because they're hungry; One can see why Sigourney Weaver frog(sorry)-marched Jeunet through Alien Resurrection, having seen this black comedy. Setting, characters and action are all off-centre and there is a romance at the heart of the film - so far, so French - but crucially, the film develops into a conventional thriller filmed in a consistently unconventional way. Alas there are no jokes in Alien IV so we had to wait until Amelie for Jeunet's first mainstream hit. I almost gave up; many of the characters are fleshed out in comic book style (imagine Judge Dredd set in postwar Paris). But a brilliant performance from Dominique Pinon as a world-weary but optimistic former showman gives the characters some line. He is offset well by Karin Viard as the murderous deli-owner's mistress. She struggles a bit with the comic slant of the film but exudes a sexuality unseen in other supporting roles (I think of her feminist in La Separation or bourgeois housewife in L'Emploi du Temps). Once the thrill-plot has emerged and the momentum has picked up one can really begin to enjoy the surrealism of the movie: an underground resistance-vegetarianisme, or a prim tenant of the deli-block moved to a series of elaborate suicide attempts.

4326,"A Movie Classic; I know that many historians have been critical of this film. They point to the fact  that this was not a factual re-telling of the actual incident. Man, they don't get it.  This was a movie. It was based on an actual incident, but in the end, it was a  movie. As a movie, it portrays the South and the issue of racism better than any  movie before it. Director Parker creates excellent characters that embody the  different perspectives of those that were involved in the civil rights crisis.  Whether it is the idealist FBI agent portrayed by DeFoe or the Southern FBI realist so brilliantly portrayed by Hackman. This movie shows us why people tried to change the South and why other people tried to preserve that South. The  result is a violent and disturbing film, which both educates and entertains. OK,  the FBI actually used huge cash payoffs to get Klan members to testify against  others in the real case. No, the FBI did not have a black agent that helped them  to crack the case.

5816,"Need not be kept a secret; I'm watching the movies of Harry Potter without read the books, unusual as it might sound to be in a position of never having read the Harry Potter books. I enjoyed the first one, and I think the second slightly has the edge over it for a number of reasons. ""Chamber of Secrets"" with the same director and almost the same cast, retains very much the same feel as ""Sorcerer's Stone,"" presenting a lengthy, expansive, and beautifully imagined world at the end of Harry Potter train (or in the case stolen hovercar) journey. This time, however, the basic characters and situations have been introduced, so more time can be spent developing the interesting characters that inhabit the school, and exploring its history. When an interesting world as detailed as this has been created it is natural that there should be room for curiosity about its history and lore, and this movie takes advantage of that. We meet parents, and learn history. In addition, the cast of child actors from the previous film have now grown somewhat and accordingly are given some slightly weightier scenes to handle, which they can do. This gives us a little more hint at character in our protagonists and allows a greater sense of attachment. In addition, while it is still there, any self-reverential tone to the original has been toned down a bit Â– as if once over the hump of making a satisfactory adaptation of a series of books with so many fans, the filmmakers feel they can let loose just a bit more. There's more humor, with very funny scenes especially early on in Harry Potter's uncle's house with Richard Griffiths. There's the addition too of Kenneth Branagh as a not-very-nice but still somehow likable and highly enjoyable character. Dobby is a delightful computer-generated character. Moaning Myrtle too is very funny. It's a complex operation to adapt such long books to the screen, I'm sure, and as such some of the niceties of the plot can get hard to pick out for non-readers, and some problems are solved by the magic-fantasy equivalent of technobabble, but that doesn't stop of from being fun adventure. It could be possible to say that the second Harry Potter film was just more of the same Â– but it's more of the same of something very fun, and a noticeably better version of more of the same.",0.0

4886,"We Scare, Because We Care; The world of Monster's Inc. is not unlike our own, but it is scattered with little detailed twists that a monster city would - deodorants that come in an assortment of gross flavours, side- walk grills that become a hazard for unsuspecting slimes, the various shaped body suits of the CDF, even adjusted idioms (""first time I laid eye on you"") ...It's all very convincing and lends credence to the very original and creative premise of Pixar's fourth. The animation holds up well and also helps with the world building; whether it's the 2.3 million individual hairs of Sulley that bounce and bristle with life, or the very complicated sequence of thousands of moving doors that must have been a nightmare to storyboard and coordinate. But it's the characters that really bring Monster's Inc. to life. Monster's University, the sequel more than a decade later, wound back time and placed original characters in a rather by- the-numbers college movie, with the usual jocks and geeks that arise in that genre. In MI, they are less one dimensional and more complex; and the voice acting is equally great. John Goodman brings a jovial and good natured Sulley to the screen, so convincing that its surprisingly scary when he finally bares his teeth and roar, the audience reacting as effectively as Boo does (""I'm off duty""). Billy Crsytal voices Mike, the wise cracking joker and best friend, delivering both juvenile and adult humour, while Steve Buscemi is Randall, the slimy rival scarer that has darker intentions. James Coburn is Waternoose, the well rounded boss who thinks first and foremost for his family's company, but also expresses regret at banishing his favourite scarer. The scene stealer is Boo, played by a infant Mary Gibbs, so young that they had to follow her around the studio and record sound bites which make up her gibberish speech. She's animated with such care and precision - there's a wonderful irony in the way she pops up in Monstropolis and says boo adorably, only to have every scary monster in sight run for their lives. Her and Sulley's relationship make up much of the emotional core of Monster's Inc. and it progresses with remarkable realism and pacing. Goodman exposes the very confines of Sulley's heart, looking beneath the agile and powerful frame that the animation presents. It's a very touching and sometimes funny relationship that develops gradually and begins to even intrude into the long lasting bond that he has with Mike. There's such a poignancy to the way Goodman delivers the line ""Did you see the way she looked at me?"" that conjures up a wealth of subtext about the overall premise of the film, their careers, the ethics of scaring innocent children the growing fatherly role he has adopted for Boo...it's neatly tied up in the ending when they switch to comedy instead of horror (which gives Mike a new-found responsibility and role) and also is much kinder and fun for the kids. The little bits of laughter from Boo and their effects throughout the film foreshadow this nicely. Randy Newman's score is also an important element. The jazzy big band influence is apparent from the opening credits sequence, and also excels in the stand out track The Scare Floor, played in the very first reveal of the elite Scarers making their way into the room and preparing for another day of screaming. The percussion beats build steadily and prepares the audience, while the jazz section swings with a wonderful rhythm that goes well with the hard work and chaos of the scare floor. The award winning is If I Didn't Have You is saccharine and pleasant, if not a little similar to Toy Story's You've Got a Friend In Me, but Goodman and Crystal play off each other well. Monster's Inc. delivers laughs and emotionally rich moments for both children and adults and is another demonstration of Pixar's ability to seamlessly combine the two in a creative and original premise.",0.025
903,"Desperate love story with murder on the wing; Vertigo (1958) This movie isn't quite about what it seems to be about at first, and we shift from an odd detective case to a case of falling in love, to a case of just falling, and then the movie goes through one of the most convincing psychological twists in cinema. That is, the second portion of the movie is a brilliant inquiry into the mind of the retired detective played by Jimmy Stewart, and into obsession, and eventually to revelation. While the crime is solved eventually, it's really a small point. This is a love story, and a complicated one but also a passionate one. The ending will leave you gasping. There are celebrated aspects to note: the psychedelic insert in the middle as a dream, the zoom/pull effects of vertigo, even the classic femme fatale/plain girl contrast (the latter a brilliant Barbara Bel Geddes). And there are some less known touches, like the green neon lighting used on the interior of the room at the Empire Hotel, or the generally clear vivid brilliant Technicolor palette. There are bit parts and famous sets (the Golden Gate Bridge and the San Bautista Mission, which didn't actually have a bell tower like this one (that was added through cinema trickery). There is also an amazing use of subjective effects--the light falling improbably, or a haze covering the scene for no reason except the main character's mind. Much of this stuff pushes Hitchcock into true art film territory, and yet he keeps it a mainstream commercial flick that is accessible and popular. Most of all there is subtle deception between characters and between the movie and the viewer. Hitchcock has never preferred the sudden surprise, leaving the viewer in ruins (or just in shock). Instead, he tells you what's going on--in this case, we learn of the murderous truth halfway through the film, so that we aren't wasting energy solving the crime but are instead trying to get into the characters' heads. It is the psychology, and the conflict of desire and doubt, that drive the movie. It's not slow, by the way, it's lyrical. Some people might object to the falseness of many of the key scenes, but that's the nature of films that are not purely naturalistic. And the nature of nearly all of Hitchcock movies after 1940. Absorb the style as brush strokes--they don't get in the way of verisimilitude once you agree the truth is not the point. Drama and beauty and originality are. All of those are here full force.",0.0

8874,"Hilarious, entertaining, enjoyable, but has an obvious plot; Mix horror, romance, a big dose of dark British humour Â– and you get a deadly concoction Â– you get Shaun of the Dead. Spoof movies so often fail with me, especially the Hollywood variety, such as Scary Movie, where you see the humour flying out at you from a mile away. I have to admit, I was a little hesitant about watching this movie. I only did so because my brother had it on DVD and insisted that I saw it. I also remember it being released in UK cinemas about the same time as the remake of the 70s zombie thriller, Dawn of the Dead, which I found disappointing and put me off watching zombie movies for a long time. But with Shaun of the Dead, I was pleasantly surprised. It starts with Shaun, the protagonist, played by screen-writer/funny-man, Simon Pegg. He's twenty-nine, stuck in a dead-end job, his seventeen year old colleague makes fun of him, he has an awkward flatmate Pete (Peter Serafinowicz), he hates his scrutinising step-father Philip (Bill Nighly), he has issues with his mother Barbara (Penelope Winton), his lazy best-mate Ed holds him back in life (Nick Frost), he gets dumped by his girlfriend Jenny (Kate Ashfield) and he spends all day in the Winchester Pub. Yes, Shaun is in a bit of a rut. Then one night, without ever really knowing why, Shaun's locality becomes 'neighbourhood of the living dead'. He is at first oblivious to it all, suffering from a hangover, but soon he realises that zombies are after his blood and he has to buck up his ideas quickly to survive. For once in Shaun's life, he has a plan. With Ed as his side-kick and armed with a cricket bat, a spade and a box of old records (which, by the way, make amusing ninja weapons to fend off zombies), and he goes to save his mum and Jenny in Pete's car. Where does he plan to take them to safety? That's right Â– the Mecca of Shaun's life and the focal point of the film - the Winchester pub. On the way, Shaun picks up Philip and Jenny's house-mates David (Dylan Moran) and Dianne (Lucy Davis). The film contains what you expect from a horror, British comedy and romance (kind of); blood, gore, action, slapstick, sarcasm, a witty script, a love interest and, sadly, an obvious plot, but I will talk more about that later. It has plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, such as when Shaun and Ed realise the first zombie they meet isn't actually a drunk girl, but a dead person who wants their blood. And when the group pretend to behave like zombies so they don't bring attention to themselves from the living dead. You will learn there is more than one use to a garden swing-ball. The end is also charming, but I don't want to speak about that. The acting is convincing for a spoof movie. Especially the lazy, rather obnoxious, Ed, played by Nick Frost, who decides to have a friendly chat on a mobile phone with a mate while surrounded by zombies. He plays your annoying fat mate who slows your life down, but is full of clever quips every now and again. He would also go off on hilarious rants with Shaun about, well, not a fat lot. I wouldn't say there were many outstanding performances or Oscar nominations in the movie though, but the movie was not made for awards. It was made to make you laugh, which is what you will undoubtedly be doing. So therefore, the co-writers Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright (the same team who made the comedy TV-series Spaced and the new movie the Big Fuzz) have certainly achieved their aim. Now back to the plot. For someone who is not a big fan of spoof movies, the storyline was so obvious, I only had to glance at the title of the movie to guess what was going to happen, and without wanting to ruin the movie for you, I was right. I can't decide if it was a spoof movie of Dawn of the Dead or 28 Days Later, but that's of little importance, the plot is too similar, for my liking anyway. I'm not the prude sort, and I think when violence, blood and expletives are used correctly, it can make a good film. I don't think Shaun of the Dead was over-run by it, but I do think it maybe should have warranted more than a 15 certificate. I do not think the film is everybody's cup of tea. The sarcasm and the wittiness I particularly liked, and the fact it was a fun, chill-out film to watch. But British humour, especially the sarcasm, and the violence and the swearing, can be hit and miss with many people. I also think more can have been done with Bill Nighly's, Dylan Moran's and Martin Freeman's characters. They are great actors and had relatively small roles than what their reputations deserve. I think Martin Freeman only had two words to say in the whole film. Maybe the actors only wanted small roles, I don't know. But I felt they were wasted, only a little as there was much more talent in the film that made up for it. There might be something else that you unexpectedly take away from this movie. The film may motivate you, to give you a 'kick up the posterior' and change your life. For Shaun, it took a town full of zombies to make him do this. I certainly hope it takes considerably less than that for the majority of you. To conclude, as I said before, I'm not a fan of spoofs, due to predictable plots and story lines, but this is way above its contemporaries. It's British. It's different. And it's dead funny; so funny you'll be laughing beyond the grave.",0.0

It is the visuals that make this movie so great, but the characters, plot and music are all top notch too, which add up to a fantastic film. Coraline (Dakota Fanning) and her family have just moved, and Coraline is bored. She has no friends in this new place, and her parents are quite intent on ignoring her. The only other kid that lives close by, Wyborn (Robert Bailey Jr.), is irritating to Coraline, and she finds the dolls in her room to be better friends. After Wyborn gives Coraline a doll that looks like her, strange occurrences begin to happen. Coraline finds a small door leading to an alternate, seemingly perfect universe where her button eyed parents feed her good food and give her presents for no reason. This universe is not all that it seems, and Coraline learns this the hard way. Henry Selick has always been about the visuals. His first film, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", showed that his knack was for the sights, and amazingly, his animation and style has evolved. ""Coraline"" is just as good looking as any of his past works, if not more so, and the animation has gotten better and crisper. Every little set, and every character is bizarrely designed to fit into this surreal movie. The main critique for this film seems to be that it has no emotion in it. Though emotions aren't a prominent aspect of Coraline, there is emotion. Coraline doesn't have a clicking relationship with her mom and dad, but that's why she loves the other mother and father so much. Coraline as a character has enough emotion to be the lead to a film like this. This wasn't meant to be a tear jerker animation. It was clearly made to bring Neil Gaiman's strange plot to life with dazzling animation. Doing the music is Bruno Coulais, and briefly They Might Be Giants. Mr. Coulais's score is beautiful, and strange, and most importantly, fitting. The music sounds how Coraline should sound, and it is a great listen. It is easily comparable to Danny Elfman's score for ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". They both have catchy, sad and unique music all rolled into one. They Might Be Giants also wrote a song, which is nice sounding, though nowhere near as catchy or lovely as Coulais. If I had any problem with this film, it would be that it didn't dive far enough into the alternate universe, but even that didn't lower the movie in my opinion. This was an excellent animated film, and is one that can actually be qualified as a family film, in that all members of the family can and probably will enjoy this. My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. PG for mild language, violence and mildly sexual animation.",0.0
5540,"Stop Giggling!; Okay, Clash of the Titans is not meant to be funny, but if you take this British production with Ray Harryhausen's tried and true stop-action animated effects none too seriously, I dare you not to have a fun time with little undue giggling. My favorite parts of this film--besides the obvious guffaw-level surprise of Judi Bowker's bare bottom in a PG movie--are found in Burgess Meredith's hamminess, Maggie Smith's nastiness, the script's blunderiness, and the one guard of the city complaining about something like the ""seething swarms of blood-engorged swamp flies."" Urgh! I don't dwell on whether or not COTT has anything more than a passing relationship to Greek mythology; I don't care because the movie is just too fun, even with the ridiculous performances and ludicrous dialogue. If I looked at this as anything other than Swiss Cheese (Swiss because you can ride Pegasus through some of the holes in the story) I would be griping about a foolish little movie not being serious. It's foolish and it's fun. Now, back to Bowker . . .",0.0
71057,"A post-apocalyptic animation; Set in a world where humanity has been destroyed by the machines it created. Before his death a scientist has created nine 'stitchpunk' little dolls, that we later learn contain aspects of his soul. As the film opens the last of these, 9, awakens. He picks up a device that he feels is important then goes exploring. He soon meets 2 who provides him with a voice before explaining a little of what is going on. Moments later a mechanical beast attacks and captures 2, it also takes the device. Soon afterwards 9 is rescued by 5 who takes him back to the Sanctuary where others of their kind, led by 1 live. 9 believes they must try to rescue 2 and against 1's orders, he and 5 head out into the wasteland. They find 2 but are soon attacked by the beast. 7, who was assumed dead turns up and defeats the beast but things get much worse when 9 plugs the device into a machine. It turns on 2 and takes his soul. The others get away but the problems are far from over; this machine makes more machines; the survivors must decide what to do; do they flee, destroy the machine or try to deactivate it and free the souls of those it has captured? I really enjoyed this film; it looked great with fantastic backgrounds, menacing mechanical monsters and most importantly the protagonists were delightfully imaginative and had a design that gave then a melancholy feel. The story is relatively simple but that didn't bother me; not everything needs to be full of twists and surprises. There is a good sense of threat throughout; some moments may be a little scary for younger viewersÂ… especially if it is made clear that the machines can and do kill the 'Stitchpunks'. Writer/director Shane Acker does a fine job bringing his story to the screen and the voice cast impresses as they bring the characters to life with distinctive personalities. Overall I'd say this won't be ideal for younger viewers but I'd certainly recommend this to fans of darker toned animation.",0.0
6101,"CAUTION: THIS REVIEW REVEALS THE ENDING; ""The Missing"" is a unique film in the way that it portrays the events that occurred in Chile. There were no unnecessary scenes and no unrealistic drama, the film got right to the point. The beginning excellently illustrates the situation in Chile as well as the personalities of the characters. What is most interesting in this movie is how real the interactions between the different people feel to the viewer. The relationship between Lemmon and Spacek (father and daughter-in-law)is at first hostile because of the current case of the missing Charles Horman. It is obvious to the audience that both the father and daughter-in-law have a hard time getting along because of their different perspectives. What struck me as the most interesting and the best part of the film was the ending. The way that the story line stresses upon the struggles of Lemmon and Spacek in the search for their missing son/husband, and then ends in their discovery of the unknown and illegal killing of Charles is a halting and realistic ending to the movie that would normally not be seen in most American films. Overall, I enjoyed this ""The Missing"" and would recommend it to anyone.",0.0
745,"""Caught bang to rights, you were!""; You can't really go wrong with Wallace and Gromit, and A Close Shave is no exception. The hilariously traditional Yorkshire duo are running a window-washing business that one day leads them to a wool shop run by a bizarre-looking British woman who immediately wins Wallace's heart, despite a deep sadness behind her eyes and a vicious-looking dog. It should be noted, by the way, that the makers of this short movie have succeeded in giving a claymation character deeply sad eyes. This alone might have been reason enough for why it won an Oscar for Best Animated Short Film. While Wallace follows his helplessly stolen heart, Gromit finds himself framed for a mysterious sheep-stealing and killing scheme and is thrown in prison. An adventure follows that could only exist in a Wallace and Gromit film and includes, among other things, a hilarious truck/motorcycle chase with the help of an incredibly coordinated flock of helpful sheep. Enjoy!",1.0
903,"Thrilling but not Thrilled; I couldn't wait to get my hands on the remastered DVD and finally see what everyone was talking about. While I think this is truly a Wonderful movie (especially for the time) I found the ending to be very anti-climatic. With all of the leading up with the sub-plot of the ""Ghost"" I was certain at the end when they returned to the top of the tower and we see a ""Ghost Like"" image slowly appear just before Novak falls, we would have seen Bel Geddes character appear to really be the ""Ghost"" and in a fit of rage push Novak to her death. Her own obsession with the Ghost story and with Scottie would have taken her over the edge and wanting to be rid of Novak. I still don't get when Scottie followed Novak to the Old Inn and sees her in the upstairs window only to be told by the Innkeeper that sometimes she indeed does stop by once or twice a week she was not there that day and confirms it by showing him the room which was indeed vacant, I just didn't get this at all. I just didn't find the whole plot to come together like I thought it would. I guess I'm the only one who feels this way. Enjoyable nonetheless.",0.0

Where ""Hot Fuzz"" parodies action buddy movies, ""Shaun of the Dead"" takes as its target movies like George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" series and its countless imitators. There's a lot of cheeky humour and grisly gore played for laughs, and the whole thing is thoroughly entertaining without ever quite feeling like a comedy classic. Grade: A-",0.0
903,"Not Hitch's best; Do not be fooled, this is by far Hitchcock's best film. I think this has a lot to do with the bare naked screenplay stripped of its social context. Which you may think is unfair. But a film in the modern era does not rely on the life-story of the director or the 'readiness' of current society to appreciate it. Perhaps Hitch was opening himself up in a way previously unseen, perhaps the film was 'off-the-wall' for the audience of the time, ushering in a new era of film-making, but let us look at this thing as a single, self-contained package. It fails dismally. The screenplay and story-line have so many holes and inconsistencies, very rare for Hitchcock, that make this film, regardless of intellectual depth, an inferior film. Regardless of how much you may 'like' or 'get it' in this film, these cinematic faults cannot be denied and rob the film very easily of its title as Hitchcock's greatest, or even as a great film, which it certainly is not. It is not a great film, perhaps a good one, but certainly not great, or even very good. It is mediocre, and we only need to reveal Hitchcock's very own admission that James Stewart's casting was an awful and unforgivable mistake that makes the entire situation unbelievable. Merely the surface of the films atrociousness. This lead actor was ridiculously miscast and that the Director of the film did not do something about it at an opportune time speaks volumes about the sloppiness of this work. Vertigo is a one of the saddest indictments of humanities willingness to collapse its opinions under the pressure of authority. An authority which started with one positive review of the film in the late sixties, a decade after the film was rightfully scathed at the box-office and cascaded to an overwhelming belief that this is one of Hitch's greatest moments. It certainly is not, in fact it is one of his saddest.",0.0
8874,"Abbott & Costello meet Romero & Jackson Â– Cult Classic in the making.; SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004) ***1/2 Horror and comedy have been going hand-in-hand ever since Abbott & Costello met Frankenstein over 50 years ago and this latest installment of the you've-got-your-chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter genre splicing from the Brits is a laugh riot shockfest the likes not seen since George A.Romero's 'Living Dead' films and the early splatter fests of Peter Jackson. Set in a rural London burg of overcast skies and proletariat listlessness the film begins with our unlikely hero and slayer of zombies in the pasty skinned form of Shaun (Pegg who resembles Mike White, Jack Black's roomie in 'School of Rock'), an electronics store clerk who seems stunted at the age of 29 going on 13, or so his out-of-his-league pretty girlfriend Liz (the fetching Ashfield) feels as she confronts him one night in his fave pub hangout The Winchester. Liz's long-suffering has come to a head and more-or-less expects some drastic changes if Shaun is to be part of her life, namely his pot-smoking lifelong chum and flatmate Ed (Frost who resembles fellow countryman Mark Addy of 'The Full Monty') whose only talent seems to be video games and taking up space. On hand for this revelation is Liz's pals Dianne and David (Davis and Moran, respectively her girlfriend and her unbeknownst would-be lover), a couple of acquaintance, who provide some moral support for the put-upon Liz. Cut to Shaun's next morning ritual of sleep-walking thru his daily trek to his dead-end job making his rounds to the local bodega and taking in the equally dank and depressive working-class enclave. Unknowingly in the background are some tell-tale signs that something is amiss in the form of an unsettling plague suddenly overtaking the country with out-of-focus TVs in the background showing scattershot footage ofÂ…well you know Shaun forgets to make dinner reservations for Liz and himself and winds up on the skids with his lady love. Depressed he and Ed go to their watering hole for some soul searching and youth rekindling as they get pissed and rap to 'Whitelines' (in one of several truly funny sequences) as they head home. The next morning Shaun goes thru his gimlet-eyed routine but there is definitely something wrong and what's so dead-on (puns more to come!) is director Wright (who makes a fine big-screen debut from a career in BBC TV programmes and co-wrote the scabrous ingenious screenplay with Pegg) accurately showing just how brain-dead life can be in the numbing daily constitutionals we take for granted replacing the monotony with monstrosity as a horde of zombies from some unknown viral infection spreads quickly as Shaun and his friends soon realize it's the end of the world as they know it! Sprinkled with liberal amounts of humor Â– both scatological and witty in-the-know as well as slapstick Â– with horror (good amount of biting and one Â– of many Â– homage scenes to Romero involving a truly nasty buh-bye a la 'Dawn of the Dead') but not exactly wall-to-wall viscera (although the blood is by the buckets) but shares in spirit more closer to Jackson's 'DeadAlive' with its gonzo-style mix of murder and mayhem and a few echoes of Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead' Ash character and even Mike Leigh's too-true working stiffs of his oeuvre and Richard Curtis' smart veddy proper British romantic comedies a la 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. Simon and Frost make a fine comic duo of not-so-dumb and dumber in their bonking on the beans of the undead as well as fine able ensemble including the pretty Ashfield as the slightly-believable gal pal (come on Shaun you're one lucky slag!) and Nighy , late of 'Love Actually', as his stepfather who endures some painful confessions. The collaborators all have had some significant success across the pond and clearly have the chops in this valentine to the previously mentioned genres (Shaun's blithering mum is named Barbara a nod to Romero's heroine in 'Night of the Living Dead'). The film is riotously funny with sharp editing (lots of montages of items being quick-pan slapped about purpose) and a few startles prior to the onslaught that totally sets the mood of this cheeky and scary horror comedy with a surprisingly sweet chewy center. A cult classic in the making.",0.0
1246,"A masterful tribute to teaching at its best; Dead Poets Society is, to use a clichÃ©, a cinematic masterpiece. I can watch it over and over, absorbing more nuances of meaning every time. As a former teacher myself (albeit of science), I view it as a tribute to the profession at its best...teaching not merely the subject but also the person, and having a lifelong impact on students' lives. The setting is Weldon Academy, a very traditional New England boys' prep school in 1959. If I can find one flaw with the movie...and there certainly aren't many...it's the underlying premise that seems to worship free thought and implies that ALL tradition is of necessity undesirable and thus to be avoided. Frankly, compared to modern classrooms which are bastions of free expression, I found the Weldon students' respectful treatment of their teachers rather refreshing. (But perhaps that's just the ex-teacher in me coming out!) Some of Weldon's ideals, generally referred to in mocking tones, are actually qualities to which parents rightfully DO hope their offspring will aspire. Robin Williams plays Mr. Keating, the English teacher we all wish we'd had. He brings warmth, passion, and an endearing quiet humor to the role as he fosters individualism in a school environment of total conformity, endeavoring to teach these young men both the beauty of the English language and the importance of living life to the full, of ""seizing the day"". How many of us mentally revolted at the dissection of poetry when we were in school? Many a viewer will both chortle and rejoice when Mr. Keating has his class rip out the methodical, emotionless ""Introduction to Poetry"" from the time honored Pritchard textbook! The ""Dead Poets Society"", and the boys on which Mr. Keating has such a profound impact, include an interesting mix of characters...Neil Perry (the passionate young man at odds with his father's clearly defined expectations for his son's life), Todd Anderson (the classic shy adolescent, through whose eyes we view the unfolding drama), Charlie Dalton (the quintessential rebel), Knox Overstreet (the teen with whom most viewers can identify, deep in the throes of first love), and Richard Cameron (the mindless conformist). Ethan Hawke gives a moving performance as Todd, the younger brother of a former Weldon valedictorian and my personal favorite, who undergoes a character transformation as the plot unfolds. In a sense, this movie is really Todd's story. As another reviewer has wisely pointed out, his best scenes are sometimes when he has no dialogue at all. Your heart will ache for him. The sub-plot of young Overstreet's romance with a girl from a nearby school may not be brilliant, but it provides some light, entertaining relief from the main drama. Needless to say, Mr. Keating's unorthodox approach meets with obstacles...from his fellow teachers, from the school's ultra traditional Headmaster, from Neil's overbearing father and the other parents, who are depicted as a conservative, status conscious lot. His encouragement of adolescent individualism leads to dramatic consequences for one student in particular, triggering a dramatic scenario that engulfs most of his classmates. I don't want to give the plot away, but Dead Poets Society has the most powerful ending I've experienced in the cinematic world. I could watch it over and over, and tears would either come to my eyes or virtually stream down my cheeks every time. It's an intelligent film, both gripping to watch and thought provoking afterward. Engaging plot, memorable characters, meaningful theme, wonderfully done scenes and atmosphere...Dead Poets Society has it all. A special tip of my hat to the cinematography; clearly, it should have won an Oscar for the final scene alone. This is a must-see movie, especially if you're a high school student who hates English. It might just change your view of the subject, even if your actual teacher doesn't quite measure up to Mr. Keating. And for everyone...not only ""Carpe Diem"", but a certain phrase from a Walt Whitman poem will take on incredible meaning and be remembered forever.",0.0
5540,"Worthy final Harryhausen film; Fortunately, Ray Harryhausen's final film is one worthy of his talents (not quite true of the two preceding Sinbad films). While I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, ""Clash of the Titans"" is quite an impressive productions in many respects. This is particularly true with regard to the use of locations and painted backdrops (and, of course, the creature effects, it goes without saying). Compared to many other mythological films, this one sticks admirably close to the actual storyline as it's been handed down. I especially liked the depiction of the gods behaving crassly - it was Greek mythology rather than Hollywood. My main complaint regarding ""Clash of the Titans"" (*SPOILER* aside from Hamlin's seventies' hairstyle and the fact that the final confrontation with the Kraken could have been more dramatic**) is the glaring influence of ""Star Wars"" (inevitable I suppose). This influence can be seen in the R2D2-like Bubo - a character obviously intended to be cute, but not one that really added much to the plot. The musical soundtrack is also very much in the ""Star Wars"" style - I thought that the ""Clash of the Titans"" was good enough that it really begged for a musical score that was intelligent, exotic, and dramatic (sadly, Bernard Hermann was no longer among the living at the time of production), not Laurence Rosenthal's saccharine fluff. But even with these distracting elements, Harryhausen's talent as an artist carries the day in the end. ""The Clash of the Titans"", compelled as it was to make certain small concessions to a lesser commercial standard of fantasy film-making, still easily rises far above the average fantasy effort in its imagery, creature effects, and literate script.",0.0

Now the plot about the whole were-rabbit was entertaining and the twist was at first well hidden and Ralph Fiennes voices his character so well, he always sounded full of evil and malice, which was perfect for his part.

6101,"Those unofficials; Growing up in the Fifties as the USA hunkered down in the Cold War it was a nostrum repeated to us time and again that no country ever chose Communism by a democratic election. When the people of Chile elected Marxist Salvador Allende with a plurality of the vote that could no longer be said. But for the USA Allende maybe because he was elected and not part of a coup he was like an aberration that had to be expunged one way or another. In the world of geopolitics Chile would be quite a prize for the other side. It's one of the leading suppliers of copper and probably the leading supplier to the world of nitrates. Can't let that country go red. So with this in mind our Central Intelligence Agency directed a military coup against Allende who either committed suicide or was murdered by those who rose against him. A very brutal dictator named Augusto Pinochet took over and his reprisals were long and bloody. Sometimes they extended to foreigners as they did in Missing. The story of Missing concerns the father and the wife of the missing John Shea who was a free lance journalist who like so many simply vanished when it was known he was an opponent of the regime. John Shea is seen at the beginning of Missing and he's a guy who hasn't quite settled down and thinking maybe this free lance journalism is what I'm meant for, finally. He fails to listen to the advice a few friends to be more discreet and not so obviously noting down the answers people give him. When he goes missing his father played by Jack Lemmon comes down from America and joins Sissy Spacek who is Shea's wife. Father and daughter-in-law search everywhere and are given nothing but stonewalling answers from the Chileans and the American officials on the scene. What Shea's cardinal sin was the discovery of those unofficial Americans on the scene, mostly of military background which contrasts the official line that America had not a thing to do with Allende's overthrow. Lemmon and Spacek got Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Actress for Missing. Lemmon who most people identify with as a comic actor kept surprising us his entire life with dramatic performances that were special. The politics of Missing are diverted when Lemmon is on and we concentrate on a father's overwhelming grief and confusion over the fate of his son. He knows the worst has happened, that's confirmed by all he sees. Yet Lemmon's expressions tell all and the same could be said for Sissy Spacek. Missing was also up for Best Picture and did win an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. It was up that year against the grand pageantry of Gandhi as were a few other worthwhile films. Missing is one unsavory story that should be told and retold.",0.0

It's not as though I were expecting much, and indeed the first fifteen or so minutes were pretty funny, but after that it was one tiresome trip.  A few of the actors were good, especially the girl who got knifed to death in the movie theatre in the first one, but somebody in Hollywood needs to tell the Wayans clan that not EVERY member of their family has the talent to be in a film.  Painfully obvious. Speaking of acting, Tori Spelling was in this one.  Normally I give her more credit than the average moviegoing critic, but she was terrible.  She has an outrageous scene that could've been the film's funniest, if she'd displayed any of the comic timing she had in ""Trick"".  Also, the director didn't allow her much, so it's not entirely her fault.  I don't normally show compassion for one of Hollywood's privelidged children, but if there was ever an actress who had to PROVE herself worthy, Tori's the one.  Keep trying, Tori. I support you. To sum up this movie, potty humor (bowel movements, body abnormalities, maturbation, vomit, kinky sex), not to mention jibes at gays and human deformities (I know someone with a deformed hand, IT'S NOT AMUSING, JUST CRUEL!) does not a funny movie make.

OK, a few rag dolls own the earth, and what? They are objects, they can't reproduce. With the too obvious reuse of Matrix / Terminator imagery, this is not for kids below 11. But after 11 they can't get the references to Frankenstein and fascism. So push it to 16, and then they're no longer interested in rag dolls. Later then? Then adults are finding the story silly. So this story tried to walk on both sides of the road and ended up ran over. The set design is nice, very Tim Burton-esque, steam-punk, and presents an alternate 1940's earth, fair enough. But again what would have happened if the machine had never woken up? Well in fact then, we wonder why the inventor said his doll would save the world, there was after all at that point only one cat sized beast he could have destroyed himself. As for the coin sized device which is the central plot item, we are left wondering how he (the inventor) managed to get hold of it if it used to be on the machine (as the machine used to be operational and no longer is, we need to assume it used to be there).

903,"Love, love, love this movie!; Okay, so I love this movie just a little! But what's not to love! One Of Hitchcock's greatest movies in my opinion. There are so many good characters in this movie - but I almost think my favorite character is the city of San Francisco. Not really, it's Jimmy Stewart. BUT San Fran sure figures prominently in the movie. What a gorgeous city. Perhaps I'm a little partial because my husband & I spent our honeymoon there 20 years ago. The cinematography alone is worth seeing this movie as it is filmed beautifully. Also, there is some artistic twists like the green lights and haze in Novaks apartment. This movie is definitely a great plot twister the 1st time you see it. It of course loses some of the bang with subsequent viewings since you know the twist. However, subsequent viewings are still enjoyable as I always notice different tidbits and details I didn't catch before. I love Jimmy Stewart in his love-sick puppy, obsession role. I love the title theme music. It starts creating tension right off the bat, and keeps your pulse going throughout the movie, anticipating what is going to happen next. I just recently re-watched the movie (probably my 5-6th time) with my 14 year old daughter, who was seeing it for the first time. I had yet been able to convince her to watch any old, classic movies with me ( too old fashioned in her mind). But for whatever reason, she agreed this time. And what a great 1st classic movie for her to see. I was surprised but she not only stuck with it all the way to the end, but was actually somewhat riveted throughout the movie! What surprised me is she somewhat predicted the ending ahead of time. That kind of shocked me because I never saw it coming the first time I watched. I'm not sure why, but Midge's character creeps me out more with each viewing. Especially the painting scene - she seems like a stalker, obsessed lover. But Bel Geddes plays her beautifully. You definitely have to see this movie. It is one of Hitchcock's best!",0.0
4388,"Not nearly as good as the original, but it has it's moments.; I think it would have been a better idea to not make this movie, but hey, they did it anyway.  I wouldn't dare say this was anywhere near as good as ""Scary Movie"", but there are a few good scenes and ideas in this film.  Some of the jokes though were just NOT FUNNY!!!  Also, I lot of the jokes were just recycled from the first film. With all that said, I wouldn't say the movie was a total waste of time, there was some really good comedy in the film and even found myself laughing pretty hard at times.  Also, if you're looking for a reason to watch this film, watch it for Anna Faris, Tori Spelling and especially Kathleen Robertson!  GOOD GOD!!! All I can say is if you liked the first film and are at all interested in this film, go for it, check it out.  Besides, it's only 83 minutes long, that's gotta be one of the shortest movies I've ever seen.  I hope you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading, -Chris",0.0
903,"Brilliant Complexity; Alfred Hitchcock never made a film of such complexity.  Vertigo is arguably his greatest film, along with Psycho, North By Northwest, and Notorious.  Its definitely the oddball of his career, which consisted of mostly suspense thrillers with romance.  Vertigo was a suspense thriller with romance, but it was incredibly multilayered and filled with ideas that are uncommonly found in films. The film, as a whole, is very deserving of its title.  The opening credits are dizzying, Bernard Hermann's score is unforgettable, and the ending is uncompromising, a rarity in a Hitchcock film.  The first hour and a half has a dreamlike feel to it, while the remaining of the film is gripping and powerful.  It is an uneven, strange, and unique film for any age, but it is undeniably one of the greatest films off all time. ",0.0
1175,"depends what you are looking for at a movie...; This movie is launching as a comedy, sci-fic, and romance.. When we judge the movie through these fields, it is just a piece of crap for me. It is not that funny so it can not be comedy, it is not a sci-fic, but it is really odd and original. If you wish to see a movie with a really different environment and way of storytelling, watch this, you will definitely find something different. I have to say that the scenes, lights, cinematography, cadrages are the most powerful items in this movie. These items are too much strong, that the story and script remains too weak besides them. And unfortunately I didn't see anything futuristic in this movie, just an old crappy building with people from 1950's. Put some green-yellowish lights to have a spooky atmosphere, and find 10 freaky characters; here you are, movie is served.. As a movie fan who believes the integrity is one of the most important criterias in a movie, I can say that this movie has just escaped the train.

2302,"Outstanding entertainment; This is one of those films, which if you completely enjoy, is as much fun to see over and over as it was initially. It is simply a perfectly enjoyable and humorous piece of entertainment. The two primary leads, the two young defendants, the main co-stars (judge, prosecutor, sheriff) and the other cast, are all excellent. One of the best features as the story was presented is that every character seemed to contribute to its humor (e.g. the prosecutor, judge, other defense attorney, sheriff, witnesses - even the dolt whom the Tomei character had beaten in a game of pocket billiards) as well as Pesci and Tomei. So often in this type of film, there are either some characters/situations which cause lulls in the story, or the writers/directors give all the ""good stuff"" to the main star(s). Not so here. The many prior comments here have covered the plot line amply. For anyone who may come across this one, if you haven't seen this film, rent it, buy it or see it the next time it's listed in a directory.",0.0
5540,"""Clash"" is a solid mix of storytelling and special effects; Clash of the Titans (1981): Stop-motion animation pioneer Ray Harryhausen's last work is unspectacular yet underrated entertainment. This solid retelling of the Greek myth of Perseus (played by Harry Hamlin) rescuing Andromeda (Judi Bowker) is fairly faithful to its source material despite some glaring errors (for instance, the mother of all monsters in this film, The Kraken, actually comes from Norse mythology). The acting is better than viewers give it credit for; in fact, Hamlin's stiff performance benefits his character portrayal instead of hurting it. The unique cast portraying the Olympians includes Laurence Olivier (Zeus), Claire Bloom (Hera), and Maggie Smith (Thetis, who wasn't among this company), plus first-ever Bond girl Ursula Andress (Aphrodite), and Susan Fleetwood (Athena), deceased sister of Mick Fleetwood, while Burgess Meredith livened up the film's dreary atmosphere as old playwright Ammon. Terrific special effects, especially the snake-haired Medusa, who is perhaps the main reason to indulge in this enticing flick. 8.5/10",0.0
8874,"Weakest of Simon Pegg Trilogy; This was 2004 - the first installment. And the cheapest, which is obvious, and the weakest of all three. I like good films with excellent and sparkling humor here and there, I like brilliant sketches and funny gags. This films has almost nothing. Nothing. Just a blatant remake of American zombie flicks, with a typical Englishness added to that - London streets, beer (I'd hate beer after watching it so much in three parts), pubs, horrible dry English accent and tons of silly profanities that add nothing, mean little and bring even less. Simon Pegg and Co do some decent job here and there, but in general, this is a very boring, overrated and unfunny film with all unnecessary gore, blood, violence and shooting added to the broth. The result? A huge shrug of mere disappointment and boredom. Could've been much better but. Big buts remains",0.0

3751,"A  pen of chickens, desperate for escape and running out of options are given a new hope when a flying American rooster lands in their coup.; Filmed entirely using Claymation technology (the same style used for the Wallace and Gromit animations), gave Chicken Run a different feel to your usual animated movie. The animation certainly isn't to everybody's taste, it doesn't look as impressive or as polished as standard animation but for me it wasn't a problem, within a few minutes I was completely used to it and barely noticed it to be different from then on. An almost all English cast worked well for the movie with the only American being Mel Gibson, playing Rocky the Rooster. This created the opportunity for the chickens to look up to the Rooster as some sort of celebrity, a foreigner who was like something they had never seen before. There are many references to great British movies through the film, some of which I picked up on and others which I have read of since watching it. Chicken Run does have a strong British feel to it, however I can't help but feel that just the inclusion of one American character made it feel a little too American. Mel Gibson stood out like a sore thumb, now I'm not saying he didn't fit the part and play a vital role, I just think that some of the jokes and amateur dramatics would have been better suited to the movie if they were a little less Americanized. On the most part the comedy is fresh and I found myself laughing on several occasions. It's a feel good flick; it's as simple as that. Its relatively predictable and plays out containing all the clichÃ©s you would expect from a movie of this genre. Overall, It isn't a perfect movie and I don't feel it contains any real wow factor and it misses the mark on any real emotion in my opinion. However the casting is done well enough, the jokes hit the mark on the most part, the animation is impressive when you consider the effort it must have taken to produce it and it is a decent way to pass the time on a rainy Sunday Afternoon, as I did. 8/10",0.875
1175,"Post-Holocaust Cannibalism, great; With French people, super-great!; I LOVE this film, the opening five minutes are LEGENDARY and I laughed out loud more times than I care to remember. I know some people (apparently the under 18 voters aren't impressed, and I say to them, why not?!) don't appreciate this film, but in my opinion it deserves a big fat 10. The film is beautifully dark and features some pretty grim issues but the whole thing comes together so well you finish the film feeling hugely satisfied, I personally watched the whole DVD with a huge gormless grin on my face just as a result of the opening scene. It's rare to find such an original, witty and dark film in today's processing-line film industry and obviously this doesn't seem to be appealing to everyone, but if they don't like it they can go watch Britney in Crossroads, whilst the rest in us bask in the reflected glory of the best thing to come out of France since Thierry Henry.",0.0
6773,"Wonderfully unique!; This is a fantastic little animated movie. The film is so wonderfully French and at the same time so universal and the quirkiness of it is so engaging. What makes it great is firstly the superb animation. It's a mixture of good old fashioned hand drawn stuff and computer work. The drawing of the characters is particularly good with each person extremely exaggerated. The cyclist has enormous and muscular calves while his upper body and face is gaunt. Then there is the fat dog, whose enormous body is perched upon four tiny limbs. All the characters are wonderfully unique and have certain character traits. I just love the animations in this, the characters become extremely likable on an aesthetic level. The film despite its French-ness has no dialogue in it and is entirely told visually and by non-dialogue audio which makes it so enjoyable. It has a great atmosphere because of the animation and the music and the real subtle humour. The dog is particularly funny. Another part that makes the animation great is the way the backdrops are drawn. The film has a really glorious sense of cinematography and the way the lighting of the sets are drawn on is quite wonderful and unlike any other animated film I have seen. The film really does look great. The score is excellent and really gives that great sense of France and gives the film much of its atmosphere. Overall this is a great movie. It's unique and extremely enjoyable. It's a visual feast and a funny little gem of a film. ****",0.027777777777777776
4388,"The weakest parody I've ever seen; This movie is terrible. I struggle to understand how this got commissioned at all. The 'movie parody' parts are hardly parodies at all, and the scenes outside of this are weak, weak, weak on comedy. The very first movie parody is of The Exorcist and I'd love the writers to explain to me how they have expanded the original to make it funny. Whereas movies like Airplane or Naked Gun used killer humour, this goes for a simple 'pie in the face' or 'fart' scenes, some of which are unintelligible to anyone outside of American sub culture. The Wayan brothers certainly have a charmed life in Hollywood. 'Airplane' started all of this - but at least that was funny, witty and had some sort of plot.",0.0
38038,"Almost everything we could have hoped for; With so much computer animation around today, Nick Park and his clay figure movers at Aardman were bound to find it difficult to prove themselves in the cinematic world. Nevertheless they managed it five years ago with Chicken Run - a great escape inspired romp that, while entertaining, seemed just a bit too bland and mainstream. And it lacked something. Or should I say some THINGS? Two things, in fact. Two characters. Yes, after five years in the making, Aardman have finally brought the names that truly put them on the map, Wallace & Gromit, and placed them in a cinema near you. And the result is everything you could hope for. Well, almost everything...the plot isn't particularly strong or unique (you will be reminded of King Kong, An American Werewolf In London and The Hulk, among others). Additionally, the humour doesn't seem to be quite as cutting edge as it was in the Wallace and Gromit short films. But the film does keep you completely involved from beginning to end, with the extended running time passing rather quickly. So yes, it can be said that the transition from small screen to big one has been a success, despite those aforementioned minor complaints. Anyway... (minor spoiler warning in the next paragraph) Our heroes now run a critter-trapping business, Anti-Pesto. Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis, as always) and Gromit have the unenviable job of keeping rabbits away from their owner's vegetables. With a vegetable competition in the town soon, business is blooming. It'll bloom even more now that Lady Tottington (an unrecognisable Helena Bonham Carter) has a rabbit problem that even Wallace and Gromit seem incapable of dealing with. But they do, much to chagrin of Tottington's fiancÃ©e Lord Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes in full on snide and ruthless mode) who believes killing them is the best solution. (Reminds you of at least one of Fiennes' characters, doesn't it?) However Wallace has come up with an ingenious invention that will stop the rabbits thinking about eating any vegetables. Some kind of mind manipulation machine, as he puts it. Great idea, sure, but a minor mistake results in the creation of the dreaded Were-Rabbit. Cue trouble. What the film lacks in thematic depth it makes up for in good all round entertainment value. Chicken Run showed us that claymation could be visually astounding, but The Curse Of The Were Rabbit is even more impressive to look at. Not that you get much of a chance when the plot picks up the pace, however. For the shorts had the amazing ability to create tense sequences and mix them with fascinating scenes & fine jokes, some more subtle than others. You want those? Well, you've got them. There's even elements of pathos and romance (just like there were in The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave) and wisely, the filmmakers do not overplay them. Any audience members who haven't seen the shorts stand a very good chance of being won over by what they see here. I really do think that The Curse Of The Were Rabbit, or any Wallace & Gromit short for that matter, is impossible to dislike in the slightest. If this isn't a huge hit already, it will be, and deservedly so. Rating: 8/10",1.0

66097,"Beautiful But Empty; ""Coraline"" suffers from the same problems that plagued ""Mirrormask"" (which it resembles so closely from a story perspective it borders on redundancy). I'll no doubt incur the wrath of the loyalists who will insist that the film is a ""fairy tale"" and as such doesn't require the same things a more ""realistic"" story does. Well, fairy tales are generally written/oral stories, and seldom 100 minutes long. In short, the film is jaw-droppingly gorgeous and that's pretty much it in a nutshell. There's no question it should be viewed in 3D; it's stunning, although digital animation has come so far recently that it makes one wonder if puppet animation is really worth the effort at this point--for all the incredible, painstaking artistry in ""Coraline,"" would anyone but a professional know the difference between this and digital, or care? Matters of plot seem to be a mere inconvenience to the film's authors (try describing it: ""Well, alternate people have buttons for eyes and there are these dogs with wings, but you have to collect magic balls so the kids can go to heaven because the witch, who is sort of like a spider, is your other mother who lives in a world through a tunnel in the wall. But the neighbor upstairs is an acrobat!), who can't wait to get to the next neato set piece or genuinely magical creative touch, and there are enough Ritalin-challenged audience members nowadays that I doubt few in the target audience (pre-teens) would mind much. It's just that, for the rest of us, the directors/producers seem to have a hard time providing an audience with the who, what, where, when, how and most importantly why we should care about the characters and their situation at all. We're plunked down into a world that is visually splendid but isn't familiar--the design style is pushed so far it's hard to tell the characters in the fantasy from the real. After an obligatory set up concerning a discontent (and, at least to this author, somewhat bratty-unto-annoying) little girl we're thrust into a breathtaking alternate reality where All Sorts Of Things Happen and Problems Must Be Solved. Like ""Silent Hill,"" which it resembles in places (and this IS a scary film at times, lots of snarling creatures, deception and sharp, pointy things coming at the camera) it all seems like it must be Very Important to someone, but ultimately leads pretty much nowhere. It's more of the same ""Isn't this so weird it's cool?"" stuff, including the pseudo Danny-Elfman-in-the-90's score. A little goes a long way; this would make an excellent short or Imax novelty movie, but the visual palette becomes overwhelming after nearly two hours. The members of the free-screening audience I saw this with were gasping for breath in excitement for the first 10 minutes, then settled into a sort of restless courtesy. I heard one 9 year old behind me sum it all up. ""It's neat, mom, but I'm *really tired*!""",0.0

The sets are wondrous, the costumes defy believe, the makeups are detailed and the music fits everything nicely. If only the story or the characters were more interesting. As they are, I have problems remembering what the plot was even about, now that some time has passed. It's that generic. There was something about a royal family torn asunder by internal struggles, a new stepmother in the middle of it all, and various sons scheming to come out on the top, but it was so hard to follow because characters seemed to change alliances on a whim and in the end I only had the barest idea about who betrayed who and stayed loyal to whom. The acting is also rather stifled. Though I blame the script more than the actors, who each have some good moments throughout the film. The interactions of the imperial family are heavily formalized, ceremonial and most of all cold, which actually might have been the case in real life as well, but a great movie it makes not. Curse of the Golden Flower is worth a watch for fans of wuxia genre. It's amazing to look at and perhaps I just wasn't in a receptive enough mood to appreciate the story.",0.0
50005,"An indisputable masterpiece, unlike anything you have ever seen.; I've not been an admirer of Zhang's work since he turned his eyes to commercial movies. However, this one is completely different. Let me start with the negatives first. There are commercial excesses in the movie, a la Titanic or King Kong (2006). Also, the colours are sometimes too saturated for the audience to appreciate. Finally, the fighting sequences are not convincing and the doctor's daughter's story is not well developed. However, everything else about this movie is breathtakingly beautiful and thought-provoking. I agree with many reviewers regarding the connection between this movie and Shakespeare's plays or the Chinese novelist Ba Jin's work. However, movies can use a lot of instruments unavailable to plays, which this movie makes full use of. The cast are simply fabulous. I cannot sing high enough praise of the acting of Gong Li. It seems that she is living the character's life. The male leads are no less great. The concept of the movie is simple yet the fine details are well taken care of by these actors and support staff, which makes it an achievement akin to a grand opera. Speaking of opera, might I add the music is wonderfully matched to the story, which enhances the dramatic effect? Watch it in theatres while you can. Or, you owe yourself to purchase this movie on DVD if you love art cinema, theatre, or opera. Don't watch or buy it if you are looking for Kungfu.",0.0
4388,"Awesome opening, decent movie; The second movie in the ""Scary Movie"" series is, in my opinion, the weakest overall. That doesn't mean that it isn't without its merits, but the whole thing seems kind of like it was slapped together over a weekend. Many of the jokes just don't work, but there are enough side-splittingly funny bits to make it all worthwhile. This movie opens with an absolutely brilliant parody of ""The Exorcist"". It starts with the singalong scene with Andy Richter as Father Harris behind the piano. ""You guys know this one?"" he asks, and then proceeds to play the opening bars of -- get ready -- ""Shake Ya Ass"". Megan Voorhees (played by Natasha Lyonne) comes down the stairs and starts peeing on the floor, interrupting the singalong. Her mother treats her like a dog! This segues into the more obvious parody of the movie with Father McFeeley (James Woods) coming in to perform the exorcism with Father Harris (""F--- this!"" McFeeley says when he first encounters the possessed girl). It's classic. Then the movie kind of dries up. The basic story is a parody of ""The Haunting"", a movie that was so bad that parody seems kind of unnecessary. It centers around a bunch of college kids going on an overnight trip to Hill House, ostensibly to study their sleep disorders but actually so the professor (Tim Curry) can summon the ghosts in the house. The only real connection with the first is found here, as some of the kids were picked because of their prior traumatic experiences (which they encountered in the first movie). Honestly, I thought the whole thing kind of rambled when I first saw it, and there were some eye-rollingly dumb jokes. But there were also a lot of very funny jokes and the cast (including Anna Faris, Shawn and Marlon Wayans, and the incredible Regina Hall from the original, mixed with vets Chris Elliot, David Cross, and Curry, Woods, and Richter) was very good; it was the writing that suffered more than anything. That, and the sloppy production values, but I guess that's nitpicking with a movie like this. Also, I didn't think the ending was very satisfying. Still, Brenda (Hall) and Cindy (Faris) messing with the ""scary"" skeleton that tries to terrorize them (""This is a skeleton -- this is bones! Would you run from Calista Flockhart?"" Brenda chides Cindy when they run into each other); Hanson (Elliot) and Dwight (Cross) arguing; and Cindy fighting a cat ""Raging Bull""-style were just some of the few very funny moments found in this movie. This may not seem like a glowing review, but I actually did like this movie and recommend it if you're into the spoof genre. Just don't expect ""Airplane!"" or even the first ""Scary Movie"" when you see it. On the bright side, it ain't ""Spy Hard"" either.",0.0

6101,"I love John Shea; 'Missing' is one of the most dramatic and captivating cinemas of its era. It deals with the true story of Charles Horman, a journalist staying in South America during Pinochet. Charles Horman is portrayed by young actor John Shea, who delivers an exhilarating performance. Its set in the 1960's-1970's during the height of Pinochet's rise to power in Chile. The movie, although remaining bias from a viewer's standpoint, still hints at the underlying deception the United States government towards Americans in Chile. The movie really makes you question your government's true intentions and forces you to always be on guard at all times. Although undoubtedly an awkward pair, Spacek and Lemmon give brilliant performances as Ed Horman (Charles' father) and Beth Horman (Charles' wife). Lemmon acts as a patriotic father coming to re-claim his son from the devilish coup that seized him. The notebook that Charles had been keeping throughout his stay in Chile ended up causing him to know too much. The director, Costa-Gavras uses a unique technique of flashback to give the viewer more in depth background and allows them to draw conclusions from what they may have forgotten. This movie doesn't concern itself with hardcore action and the blood and guts of normal war movies, but instead concerns itself with the emotion and new-found distrust felt by Ed Horman. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys outstanding acting performances and John Shea movies. The star of the film, John Shea, provides some emotion and I recommend you see 'Missing' if only to see him.",0.0

903,"In Circular Motion; From the very start, Saul Bass's innovative introduction, reportedly the first ever to use computer graphics, sets the film's overall circular motif in motion. The physically debilitating condition of vertigo, which is triggered by the central character's acrophobia, is the engine that generates all of the events that follow. Several reviewers here focus on this film's status as ""number one"" among at least some lists devised by critics who actually dare to rank movies, and these same writers spend an inordinate amount of time and effort challenging its high position. For what it's worth, I have created a list of my favorite 150 movies of all time, and ""Vertigo"" is right there along with seven other of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces, but I personally find the numerical ranking of movies, including the best of them, to be all but impossible. How could I rank the movies that I love the most? I find it interesting that Bernard Hermann based his remarkable, ever changing musical score on the Wagner opera, ""Tristan and Isolde"". Although I am not an opera expert, that music has always suggested a circular motion much in the same way that Hermann's score, especially the opening theme, creates the dizzying sensation that the physical condition of vertigo produces in its victims. James Stewart, Kim Novak, and Barbara Bel Geddes are excellent in their roles, especially Stewart, whose character, John (Scotty) Ferguson, experiences a wide range of powerful and complicated psychological conditions, which could not have been easy to portray. Regardless of how Hitchcock was reported to feel about her performance, I believe that Novak brings just the right amount of mystery, intricacy, and physical beauty to both Madeleine and Judy. Lana Turner, also considered for the lead, would not have offered the same depth and complexity to the role. I also appreciated supporting cast members Ellen Corby as the cautious and peculiar apartment house manager (did she know more than what she appeared to know?) and Henry Jones as the anal retentive trial official who publicly humiliates Ferguson in a devastatingly cruel way. In addition to the excellent direction, musical score, and acting, the magnificent cinematography of Robert Burks, who maximizes the photogenic setting of San Francisco and its picturesque surroundings, and the intelligent screenplay by Samuel A. Taylor have kept ""Vertigo"" on my own list of favorites after nearly six decades and many repeated viewings. Just don't ask me to rank it.",0.0

And the music is amazing. Vertigo and Psycho must be the best works of Mr. Hitchcock. He is great when it comes to mystery and suspense. I wish it could be shown at the theater again. It would be worth it or I wish the TV could show Vertigo a little more than Psycho. They send that one a lot more and I'm kind of tired of Psycho.",0.0
4886,"Bravo!; In recent years, most Disney films have sacrificed heart and human emotion for ""look, no hands, ma!"" animated virtuosity, manic ""comedy"" performances by the likes of Robin Williams, and sloshy musical numbers with one eye on a Best Song Oscar and the other on a #1 Hot 100 chart position. Thankfully, ""Monsters, Inc."" rectifies the situation by being smart, witty, and cracking good fun--WITH a heart. Produced in association with Pixar, the visuals are stunning; you are actually tricked into thinking you're watching live action and certain points. But savvy effects a good film does not make. Enter John Goodman and Billy Crystal, who give voice to the film's unlikely heroes: Sully, a teddy bear-ish, blue-and-purple monster who is the good natured ""#1 Scarer"" at Monsters, Inc.; and Mike, Sully's wisecracking, one-eyed best buddy and colleague. Goodman and Crystal are pitch-perfect together, making their characters' comfortable, affectionate banter sound easy and natural. When Sully and Mike's lives are turned upside down by a ""child security breach""--Sully accidentally lets a 4-year-old tyke into the monster world--the gags and action never stop. What's most effective, however, is the growing bond between Sully and ""Boo,"" the nickname he gives to the toddler. It is sentimental and sweet without being manipulative or cloying, and offset by Mike's reactionary, seething resentment. This movie has it all: lovable characters for the kids; witty visual and verbal gags aplenty for the adults; and a rollicking good story for everyone. Plus, the ending ranks among the best I've seen all year: I defy you not to be touched!",0.025

1080,"The best Pyton movie and my favorite comedy movie; As a Jew, I grew up with studying a lot about the roman domain over Judea, I read a good sum of book on this matter, including The Jewish War written by the Jewish general Flavius Josefus. One Thing that I can say for sure is that this movie is the best representation of this era. The movie is about a man (Brian Cohen) who is confused with the messiah, he was born in the same day, just a few meters from Jesus and somehow people get confused about them in the process. It has the despair of the people over the roman rule, they got the messiahs that appeared during this time(the two most famous being Jesus and Simon Bar Korbach). They got the hate between the different groups inside the Jewish people at that time. They got really good jokes about some religious believes like saying the name of god (which is forbidden in Judaism). They even got the flying saucer from the bible. With the best ending possible (totally unexpected). I rate this movie 10/10.",0.0
66097,"Surprisingly one dimensional...; Let me frank here: I love Neil Gaiman (his work, that is), I love Henry Selick, and I love animation. Coraline was the first Gaiman novel I ever read, and when I found out they were making a movie, I literally leaped for joy! Then I saw the clip online and thought it was weird for Coraline to have blue hair -- okay, not bad. Then I heard she was going to be voiced by Dakota Fanning (Ew), that they rewrote the story so that some kid named Wybie would be in it, and that They Might Be Giants would supply the soundtrack. My hopes were fading... I'll sum it up for you right now: this movie has the BEST animation Henry Selick has ever done -- bar none! The visuals are breathtaking--no, spectacular! The music was catchy, the jokes were good, and the acting first class. The problem is that the pace of the story moves too quickly and none of the characters, except for Coraline, are given any kind of development. Coraline obviously proves to the most engaging character throughout the story, but everyone else feels sorely misplaced. Her parents are mean to her one minute, then nice to her the next; Wybie is zero one minute, a hero the next; and the cat goes from being a sarcastic freak of nature to being Coraline's best friend. What happened here? There is virtually no character development. And what about the plot holes? Yes, I'm sorry to say that even in a film as beautiful as this there are plot holes. Such as, why on earth did Wybie give Coraline the doll in the first place? Why didn't the Other Mother just give it to Coraline herself? Why isn't Coraline the least bit scared when she sees the Other Mother for the first time? Would she really be courageous enough to eat there after just having eaten in the real world? How come Coraline's parents can't remember what happened after they've been released from the snow globe? And why does Coraline act like nothing is wrong when the cat suddenly begins talking to her in the tunnel. Obviously, I'm over-analyzing things here, but many of the film's faults are glaringly on the surface. Overall, I have to say that The Nightmare Before Christmas still remains my favorite Selick film. Coraline is GOOD, but at least ALL the characters in Nightmare were one- dimensional, whereas Coraline is the only three-dimensional thing going.",0.0
1246,"Neat movie that shows much unfairness.; Peter Weir (The Truman Show, Green Card, Witness) has done many good movies, and I always look forward to seeing his latest work. ""John Keating""  Robin Williams (What Dreams May Come) inspires his students toward free thinking and poetry.  One the students had a father who did not have a clue about understanding his son's emotional needs causes the kid to commit suicide. Not taking responsibility for his own actions, the father incites the school head master to get rid of the professor. That was the sad part to me because in other boarding school movies such as: Circle of Friends, Scent of a Woman (at least partially a boarding school movie) the good wins, while in the Dead Poets the teacher gets fired. I did not like that unfair side of it. The kids do make a statement against the firing but primarily the bad guys win, at least that is my perception. The teacher wanted to inspire the students,  not the stuffy headmaster, and in that he succeeded. I liked the fact that in this movie we have boys interested in poetry and not girls, which breaks some stereotypes. I enjoyed the movie. The cinematography is pretty. Ethan Hawke was a cute young adult when this movie was made.  Favorite Scenes: The kids meeting at night in their secret place. The boys memorizing poetry on their own. John Keating, stepping on the desk: ""We must look at things in a different perspective.""  Favorite Quotes:  ""Four disciplines: Brilliance, honor, discipline, excellence.""  Professor John Keating: ""Seize the day"";  ""Words and ideas can change the world.""; ""Strive to find your voice""; ""We are not laughing at you.  We are laughing near you.""  I think that Julliard graduate Robin Williams has proven to be one great and versatile actor, and no small wonder he is an Oscar winner. He has played many parts that are completely outside of the scope of his funny self.  ",0.0

I'm not a big fan of comedies since the premise usually over stays it's welcome by at least half an hour , but screenwriter Dale Launer has crafted a very funny , well paced script that succeeds because of the amount of obstacles for the characters . Lawyer Vincent Gambini is warned by the judge to get a suit , so he gets a suit only to find there's an obstacle in the way . Vincent stays at a hotel , but there's an obstacle in staying there . Every time a character the audience feels for looks like they're going to get a lucky break ( Vincent especially ) another obstacle appears barring their way . A superlative example of pacing a script . Launer has also written things that at first appear throwaway at the time like eating grits at a diner but then incorperates them into the plot later on . Not only that but Launer has written a script with gags that are both credible and funny , even the skit involving possible sexual abuse in prison ( They'd have to be one of course ) isn't as silly as it could have been The cast are pretty good too with Joe Pesci showing that he's just as good as a comedy leading man as he is at playing Italian American wiseguys .

38038,"great family entertainment; Finding a movie which my parents, my kids, my wife and I all enjoy is nearly impossible. Strangely, 007 movies and Austin Powers movies have been the only movies so far to keep everyone's attention, however they are often inappropriate for the boys. The notion of competitive gardening and the threat of pests introduced early in the movie connected with everyone in the group. Humanely treating the growing population of captured rabbits presents an interesting conundrum. The characters were well drawn and familiar, our minister hums ""all good gifts around us"" much the same way as Wallace's minister. The action had a pace which kept everyone sitting forward and the comedy kept them grinning. I have always been a stop motion animation fan and still have a super-8 camera which I used for animation years back. I appreciate what hard work each frame is. Nick Park and company have made a movie which indulges both the artists and the audience. So I can share my appreciation of this art form with those I love.",1.0
903,"VERILY, THE GREATEST; Truly, the greatest piece of cinema ever made. Having screened this masterpiece about 50 times, I will just hint, in a brief paean, to its greatness. The density of thematic material, the multiple levels of meaning within meaning, and the profundity of the themes it deals with are virtually staggering: The nature of love, the effect of death on life and on the living, the relation of beauty to love, appearance versus reality, the spiritual and the physical, the might-have-beens in life, the nature of reality---need one say any more? There is not one film, to my knowledge, that says so much, and asks so many questions about, these fundamental issues. It may be true to say that the film asks more questions than it answers, but questioning is the beginning of the road to understanding. Watch this film a few times, and then go to the books: Robin Wood, Tania Modleski, and follow their bibliographies on your journey to understanding.

4886,"Not as good as the other Pixar movies, but still great; Monster's Inc. is another part of the great Pixar movies. Pixar really is the leading company in CGI effects. If you look at it, Pixar introduced the first fully computer animated movie Toy Story to the world in 1995. Ever since then, Pixar has continued to make movies and other company's like Dreamworks have also gotten started. (possible Spoiler) Monster's Inc. follows the world in which monsters live in. Their everyday job is to go into kid's rooms at night and scare them, because their screams are useful for energy in the monster world. The two main characters are the green one eyed Mike(voiced by Billy Chrystal) and Sully(voiced by John Goodman) who are the best workers of Monsters Inc. and are competing against an evil monster named Randall(voiced by my all time favorite actor Steve Buscemi). Despite being the fearless and ferocious monsters that they are, they are never supposed to touch a child or any of its belongings, because they think children are toxic. Everything goes wrong when a child happens to come into their world and isn't afraid of the monsters, but the monsters are afraid of her. The rest is pure fun, Pixar style. Most kids should enjoy this, it is possible that kids around age three will be scared by it, but it will probably make them braver about their fear of monsters.

Shaun live in the basement of an apartment in London, together with his lazy buddy Ed. Having lazy days running by their life seems to be; nothing! Shaun's girlfriend leaves him and his having problems with his mum and da.. stepdad. Being in a heavy heartbreaking time, he and his friends simply don't follow up with the everyday world going by. And soon; London is a city filled with man-eating zombies.. one man has to stop the madness; Shaun... SHAUN OF THE DEAD is simply a small masterpiece. Featuring hilarious scenes as when Ed and Shaun starts throwing old records at two zombies in their garden, discussing what's worth throwing and not. The genius plan going-threw by Shaun, where everybody's smiling like it was all a fancy commercial. Or; the great achievements of ""you've got red on you"", the typical comedy gold of Shaun trying to take a short-cut over a fence... I could go on for ever. SHAUN OF THE DEAD is truly one of the funniest movies ever made; and its a coming cult classic! It's got a lots of the same Monty Python achievements of originality and exciting comedy, and being a success world wide!

5540,"""Titan""-ic effort....; Why should everyone be surprised with all the ""Star Wars"" allusions in ""Clash of the Titans""? Both films have young heroes destined for greatness (Hamlin), a princess in peril (Bowker), a bearded old man watching over him (Olivier), mechanical cohorts (Bubo the Owl/Robot), and a villain looking to destroy all that is good (McCarthy).  Check it out, they even had the Hildebrandt brothers (who designed the original ""Star Wars"" poster) design the original release poster for COTT. Then again, ""Clash"" has it roots in Roman mythology, where there are such fearsome creatures as the Medusa, Calibos, the Kraken, the Stygian witches, and all manner of huge scorpions, two-headed dogs and other plagues of the gods to befall all who disobey them. There are more wonders still in Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion animation of the more fantastic of the creatures here.  True, it looks outdated when compared to what can be done nowadays, but it's vision enough for young children to watch and be swept up in the action of a long time ago....

When I became more literate about film and history, DPS became more of a problematic movie for me to watch. Possible spoilers ahead! If the film that is set in the 1950s and deals a lot with poetry, why does it include poems by Herrick, Tennyson and Byron yet omit writings from people like Kerouac, Ginsberg and other post-modern authors?  There is too much of an emphasis on the strictness of the times and the adults besides Keating are portrayed solely as authority figures.  Neil's suicide seems like a perfunctory way finish the film.  Why couldn't he have run away to Hollywood or something similar to that?  The build up of his character becomes a let down when he doesn't stand up to his father and takes a coward's way out.

903,"The biggest mystery is how did this film become so highly rated?; I am a big fan of Hitchcock but how this hits the high ratings is a bigger mystery than the film itself. The first 20 minutes or so give's you an indication that its going to be another classic. Sadly, like me you will be wrong. If you are looking to watch your first Hitchcock film to see what all the fuss is about then don't watch this. The directing of the film isn't I suppose the problem but the story has the excitement factor of a roller coaster climbing slowly slowly for over an hour, levelling out for 20 minute's before hitting a few promising bumps which will then lead you to being chucked off with nothing more than whiplash from your chin hitting your chest as you continuously nod off. Without going into detail or being a spoiler, this film laboriously drags out with a retired detective (James Stuart) being paid to follow his friend's wife(Kim Novak)employed by the friend himself as he has concerns for his wife's mental stability due to strange reasons. All the obvious things happen boy/detective meets girls sort of stuff and you will begin to build your theory of what's going to happen which may or may not be correct, but you wont care either way as disappointment will set in long before the end. If you do manage to stay awake to catch the ending be prepared to shake your head, re-write it your self and wonder why you didn't listen to me and save your self a few hours in the first place. I suppose their is a twist which you would expect, but theirs not enough depth to the mystery to make it worthwhile. I advice if you intend to watch this film from start to finish indulge with ample amounts of caffeine and be prepared to shut out the whiny music that begins to annoy. In my opinion not one of his finest hours as you may of gathered, nor a must see film.

903,"For me, the perfect Hitchcock film; I like to be in a good frame of mind when starting a film, because if distracted, it will affect the way I process it. So, after a few false starts, I finally have seen VERTIGO, and what I feel to be the perfect example of a Hitchcock film. The story follows John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, a retired San Francisco detective who is called by a friend to follow his wife. Along the way, he falls in love and has some curious experiences revolving around mistaken identity and his fear of heights. Dare I say that James Stewart hasn't been better (at least in a Hitchcock film) than here. Kim Novak also acquits herself rather nicely in the typical Hitchcock blonde role, although I still think Grace Kelly is a slightly better actress. All of Hitchcock's tricks are put to full use here, and things start off brilliantly with my favorite title sequence so far. Saul Bass and Bernard Herrmann were two of Hitch's greatest collaborators, and they certainly did some of their best work here. From a story perspective, the narrative takes a number of twists and turns which a discerning viewer will probably figure out beforehand, but its the execution of said twists that really make them work. They aren't telegraphed, but rather are hinted at or suggested. And if there's anything that makes a Hitchcock film extremely watchable, is how he is able to manipulate audience expectations through the power of suggestion. From a technical perspective, there was quite a bit of impressive camera-work and photographic effects that add to a sense of disorientation and suspense. In particular, there are a few zoom in/track out shots that visually illustrate James Stewart's character's acrophobia. There was also a really trippy dream sequence that served as a nice reprise of the opening title sequence. Even the production design, sets, costumes, etc. added to the visual splendor. Even when the narrative slows down (to ease the tension), there's always something beautiful to look at, be it a person or one of the many on-location shots of downtown San Francisco. And finally, Bernard Herrmann's score was pretty much perfect, helping to build tension at the right moments and backing off when necessary. A couple key moments in the film happen sans score, and the mark of a good composer is knowing which moments to back off and let the drama speak for itself. Put together, all of the various production elements form a package which, to me, is the epitome of what Hitchcock brought to cinema. You have interesting (and attractive) characters, a suspense-filled story, brilliant camera-work and a rapturous score. Even the ending this time felt better than in his other films. Although it would probably benefit someone new to Hitchcock to start with something earlier in his filmography (to get a sense of progression), VERTIGO is probably the pinnacle of his style and certainly essential when it comes to film classics.",0.0
38038,"Timeless Clay; There is something nostalgic about a Nick Park Wallace and Gromit piece. There's never any indication of a specific time span in the films, though there does seem to be slight indications of a narrative flow and an overall sense of travel, but nowhere do we find the sort of thing that one sees with the Simpsons (nobody in the Simpsons ages, though they do seem to move through time periods; but Bart in the early 90s was a kid and 20 years later, he's still a kid, while the family can look back and remember when he wasn't born). Wallace and Gromit can look back too, and perhaps if there was more to their story, we'd also notice they never age... however, their world is placed in a timeless place that echoes the 50s and 60s. Nobody has a computer. Wallace builds a rocket in the short 'A Grand Day Out', but either he missed Neil Armstrong proving once and for all that the moon isn't made of cheese, or that grand worldwide event has yet to happen in his world. Animation has the ability to be timeless, yet it has to relate to us in a way that makes us comfortable. Wallace and Gromit inhabit that rare place of nostalgia. Their adventures are new, but there's a quaintness to them, like sipping hot chocolate and hearing wild yet tamed down stories of the adventures your grandparents used to have. The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is exemplary for providing us just such a tale. It's cheeky in places if you're old enough to get the jokes, but never offensive. It presents modern ideas (vegetarianism, humane treatment of animals), that doesn't share much of a place with the time period it hearkens back to, but is subtle enough that many years from now, we won't feel off put by it. It's a safe, pleasant, quite-often-hilarious tale that we'll want to return to... watching this movie is basically like hugging your favorite pet dog. Of course, your dog is probably less inclined to wake you up in the morning the same way Gromit is.",1.0

1246,"A life lesson.; In this film, the life of a conservative school for rich young people is changed by the arrival of a poetry teacher with ideas and unorthodox methods. Directed by Peter Weir, has a screenplay by Tom Schulman and features Robin Williams in the lead role. It won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and is regarded as the consecration film of Williams' career. For me, its one of most moving and uplifting films I saw. In a world where the task of teaching is often undervalued by parents, pupils and even by governments, this film shows how a teacher can change the thinking and life of a student, for the best or the worst. In order to teach its enough to know, but to be a good teacher you must have passion. And it is precisely this love of the act of teaching (and what is taught) that transforms and captivates students. Another powerful message that this film conveys is the importance of thinking in an original way, according to our own head, instead of thinking according to what others preach. Finally, the film draws attention to the limited time we have to be better than we are, ""seize the day, and make your lives extraordinary"". The cast were up to the challenge but Robin Williams holds the whole audience with an accurately and deeply moving performance. The sets and costumes are good, managing to perfectly recreate the atmosphere of schools of rich and privileged students. Photography is regular.

4388,"Rather disappointing.; Saw the film after it hit theaters on July 4th.  No fireworks for this film, and not much reason to celebrate, either. While the first one was a surprise hit, the only hit this one is going to make is a loud noise as it strikes bottom. There are numerous bodily function jokes, that get quite graphic, and when you're trying to munch on popcorn and candy while sucking down some drink, it's not very pleasant to watch.  Thankfully the thought of the eight dollars I spent on candy, drink, and popcorn was stronger than my stomach.  Why the Wayans felt they had to go to such extremes, I don't know. It's like the film is trying to top the last one, but sacrificing anything appealing to viewers.  Sure, there are some funny moments in this film---the talking bird made the whole theater (all thirty people) laugh out loud, and Chris Elliot tries a little too hard, but he does have his moments.  Everything else that goes to extremes, from the jokes on excrement and urination to making fun of the handicapped, just doesn't seem to hold its own. I'm almost sorry I went to see this film---I should have been smarter and gone to see ""Cats And Dogs.""  If I'd known what was in this film, I wouldn't have chosen to see it.  However, if you can sit through about an hour of cheap laughs, physical humor (LOTS of it), and jokes about bodily functions, the handicapped, and stereotypes, then you're welcome to do so.  If you really want to spend a few hours watching something like this, though, my reccomendation to you would be to stay home and rent the first one. It's just as disturbing as this one, but at least it has style. This film does not.",0.0
903,"Alfred Hitchcock's Pre-""Psycho"" Psycho; Vertigo has got to be one of the most absurd and disturbing movies about men and their ""modern-day"" mental illnesses that I have ever seen. It's true. The mental illness that I'm talking about here is, of course - Men's totally twisted and fanatical obsession about having complete and absolute control over women. You know, I'd say that when it comes to one of Hitchcock's most psychotic ""movie-psychos"" of all-time - Scottie Ferguson here in Vertigo makes Norman Bates from Psycho look, by comparison, as if he were ""normal"", yes, NORMAL. I mean, Scottie was one really whacked-out maniac, that's for sure! Personally, I think that director Alfred Hitchcock went way too far out on a shaky limb with this one. And, being way out there, he ended up losing his balance and, literally, getting ""vertigo"", himself. This film is nothing but a bird's eye view of a supremely grotesque freak show with Scottie (representing the average American psycho, I mean, the average American male) as the main monster of attraction. At a running time of 130 minutes, Vertigo really only begins to pick up steam in the last 30 minutes. The first 100 minutes of it is just endlessly drawn out 'build-up', extremely drab, most of it.",0.0
50005,"Too much and too little; This is just my afterthoughts after seeing this movie. I am not a huge movie fan and I don't know how to write a ""proper"" comment. :) It requires a fair amount of knowledge of the Chinese traditional culture or beliefs in order to understand what is going on in the movie. The lack of it will significantly decrease the enjoyability of this movie, rendering the audience feeling ""funny"" or ignorant of what is being presented: - According to some very ancient Chinese literature, The Chong Yang Festival was celebrated in the royal palace with Chrysanthemums and the evergreen plant (called simply ""the berries"" in the movie). This festival gives the stage to the story. The youngest prince in the movie has explained this festival really quickly, but I am sure many people just missed that. - And just before that, when the King saw his sons coming up the tower to meet him, he said: ""To the highest mountains my brothers ascend, but one is missing the berries in his hair."" It is from a Tang Dynasty Poem by Wang Wei, meaning how the poet had missed his homeland on the day of the Chong Yang Festival, and he regretted that he was not among his brothers on that day. And ""the berries"" was actually a medical herb and also a talisman to ward of evil according to Chinese legends. This herb finally appears when the royal family put them on at the night of Chong Yang Festival in the movie. - Chrysanthemums means longevity. Chong Yang Festival was also known as the Chrysanthemums Festival. Chrysanthemums wine was drank on that day too. - Legend has it that the family should leave home on Chong Yang Festival to avoid disaster. Another way of seeking longevity. Though the family relations were a mess in the movie, I didn't miss the point when the King grabbed the Queen's hand and wrote together the four Chinese characters: ""Loyality, Filial Piety, Ritual, Righteousness"". It is too ironic to see a traitor like the King himself emphasizing on these things again and again. And the tragedy of this royal family all came from the lack of these virtues in the father, and he could not force his children to do them without setting up a good model. Since this movie was about family feud, I want to see the story more than the special effects or martial arts. However, it fails to touch people's hearts because all characters are so hard to relate to. If the Queen was to be thought of as a victim, so were her treacherous, rebellious, or foolishly loyal (not in any particular order) sons. I think more time should be spent on building up the story instead of making the relations so complicated. At the point where the story is supposed to reveal a secret, I just feel so disgusting instead of surprising. I think if the movie could provide a positive side of the human nature (there is a little bit found in the doctor, but it is definitely not enough to leave any impression) as a contrast to what this royal family is doing, it would make this movie more memorable as we could relate to what values the director could have believed in or could have wanted to show. And to compare Prince Jie to Hamlet? He didn't even ask himself to be or not to be and made his decision in less than a minute!",0.0

71057,It's over already?; The movie is just too fat considering that it presents a very complex world base setting. Also there appears to be a gaping plot hole not taken care of by the story about how did the scientist lose all the other eight figures before he make the ninth? The movie is so gloomy that as animation it doesn't really suit the children audience. Yet it's also very short that it may only waste the audience's time watching it. The animation quality is very nice. They are smooth and detailed and one can really say that it is proportionate on terms of body measurements of the characters. The voice acting is at a good level overall. Elijah Wood's voice is nicely very recognizable and he did his part well enough that it gives the character depth for 9. Jennifer Connely did well in playing as the independent and courageous female of the group as 6. Christopher Plummer really completes the group in his performance as the cowardly 1.,0.0
6101,"Great drama and suspense; This film, ""The Missing"", opens up really slow. I have to admit that I was hesistant with the rest of the film however it picked up and became very suspenseful. The director of the movie did a great job creating suspense and also appealing to the audience's emotions. During the movie many scenes, especially where Ed and Beth are searching for Charles, it creates a mood that many of the audience can relate to. Almost everyone has someone that they are close with, not just family but even a friend that would help them to feel the grief Ed and Beth experienced. For example the scene where Beth discovers her friend Frank dead and unidentified brings her to tears and the audience could just sit and watch as they know the pain she must be feeling. Costa-Gavras did a great job building suspense and keeping in touch with the audience. However, I did feel that the film lacked a bit of clarity to the end of the movie. Throughout the movie it carried on as though Charlie was alive and even though his father and wife were having trouble locating him, he would turn up sooner or later. The scene were his father was told the horrible news, doesn't seem very credible. As in the scene before where he was reported killed in the stadium, which he actually wasn't, caused a lot of confusion when it came time to relieve the death of Charles Horman. Although the sad ending, the movie reflected well the real-life experiences many people lived through and the unfortunate few who suffered much like Ed and Beth Horman.",0.0
66097,"Good.....but not a classic; I only recently watched Coraline after hearing so many positive things about it. I think it has some moments that causes the viewer to think about the deeper hidden meaning of the story, hence the whole ""be careful what You wish for"" title on the DVD. The moral is obvious and simple, which is not necessarily a bad thing, it depends on how it comes across. Basically the movie is about a 12 year old girl who has parents that could care less about Her, She finds a door to a secret world, thinks it is all fun and games but soon learns otherwise.....from what I heard I expected a little bit more out of the plot, the trailer makes the movie look a lot more interesting than it really is to be honest. The movie has good moments towards the end, but before then the movie was a little flat. There could have been more detail about the main villain of the movie ""the other mother"" and why exactly She kept children's souls locked away. I must say however the voice acting, and animation were on point. This film is probably enough to entertain a kid 12 and under but it is not my taste.",0.0

The second one should have been thrown away before it went into production. Why? They didn't care. The introduction parody of the Exorcist approaches the level of comedy of the original and shows how funny James Woods can be but after that it goes downhill real fast. Which leads me to wonder if they started out with as much enthusiasm as the first, but got lazy and decided just to slap something together. And why not, it seems slapped together from left over ideas they probably wrote over one weekend and contains zero of the care of attacking all the little details of horror movies.

6101,"'You play with fire, you get burned'; Imagine living in a country whose Socialist government is toppled in a US-backed military coup. Here is the based-on-truth story of Charles Holman, a somewhat naive New Yorker who for unclear reasons is living in Chile when a ruthless junta takes over. Suddenly anyone out on the streets after curfew is in danger of being shot. Probably Holman, who dabbled in writing, saw things that were threatening to the regime or its ties to the US. He winds up being one of thousands summarily executed during Pinochet's reign of terror, only to be buried in a wall. There is a convincing performance here from Jack Lemmon, who starts out being resentful about the inconvenience his only child has brought about. Gradually he comes to admire the feistiness of his cynical daughter-in-law, played a little tediously by Sissie Spacek, as they try to learn the fate of their loved one. Experiencing the horror of a society under siege is the most memorable thing about this film. =================================== From Wikipedia: Missing, a film based on the life of U.S. journalist Charles Horman, who disappeared in the aftermath of the Pinochet coup.",0.0
5540,"Clash of the CGI; Hi. I saw this yesterday. It's a very funny adventure movie. The best scene is the fight with Medusa which is totally awesome. She is so scary and creepy. Anyway, I would agree with those who say that effects are bad for its time. I would have sworn that the movie was from the 60s or 70s so imagine my surprise when I saw it was from 1981. If you compare it with ""The Thing"" which is also from the 80s the effects in ""The Thing"" are so much better. Actually I fell asleep yesterday (I was tired) before the final fight with the Kraken but I seem to remember having seen that scene before. At least it's an excellent idea. I would like to see an adventure movie like that. On the level of ideas it is more eidectic (vividly fantastic) than ""Lord of the Rings"" by Peter Jackson.

4886,"I always knew there were monsters under my bed!; `Monsters, Inc."" is the latest full length computer animated feature from Pixar and Disney, the team that practically launched the genre back in 1995 with ""Toy Story."" That film was inspired by one common childhood fantasy (that your toys come to life when your not looking), and this is inspired by another: that there really is a monster under the bed or in the closet. However the monsters in this movie are in fact just regular working Joes from ""Monsters, Inc."" the company that supplies power to their home world by capturing childrenÂ‘s screams. As soon as thatÂ‘s done they nip back home via the portal that exists behind every closet door in the world. The companyÂ‘s most successful child scarer is the huge blue and furry James P ""Sully"" Sullivan (voiced by the suitably robust but tender John Goodman), whose partner is the walking, talking, smart mouthed eyeball Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). However their lives are thrown into chaos the Sully inadvertadly brings a small girl back with him. This time round John Lassiter Â– PixarÂ‘s head honcho, driving force and director of ""Toy Story,"" ""A BugÂ‘s Life"" and ""Toy Story 2"" Â– has taken more of a back seat role, handing the directorial reins over to a duo who have both worked on PixarÂ‘s other titles. However youÂ‘d hardly notice; the film has the CGI sheen and spectacular action scenes weÂ‘ve come to expect, along with a plethora of visual gags & in jokes (including tips of the hat to PixarÂ‘s previous movies), and a razor sharp script that will once again ensure the film appeals to adults as much as kids. DreamWorks may have taken PixarÂ‘s place as HollywoodÂ‘s preÂ–eminent CGI filmmakers for a while last year, but as good as ""Shrek"" was, ""Monsters, Inc."" is better!",0.025

50005,"An Intriguing Movie Full Of Secrets And Lies; This is a pretty good movie that offers an obviously fictionalized look at life behind the scenes in the court of the Tang Dynasty of 9th century China. Given the apparent fascination movie makers have with dysfunctional families, it's perhaps not surprising that this fascination has spread to China. The family of Emperor Ping makes the House of Windsor look like paragons of virtue by comparison. The Emperor is slowly poisoning his Empress. Why he's doing that is a bit of a mystery, but the story is slowly revealed. Each of the Emperor's three sons get involved in the intrigue in various ways, and the result is a sometimes bewildering series of events in which it's hard to know exactly who is plotting against who from moment to moment. In spite of the obvious soap opera feel, the movie is interesting enough and offers a spectacular glimpse (if accurate) into the opulence of a 9th century Chinese Emperor's court. The movie lacks the heavy martial arts emphasis that some of the Chinese historical epics are full of, but it should be noted that what there is in this movie is less ""beautiful"" in its portrayal than in some others movies, as well as being exceptionally violent and at times bloody. There are secrets galore that keep coming out as the movie goes on - certainly enough to retain the attention of the viewer.

However, Alice's terrible taste in men once again puts paid to this progress.. Martin Scorsese's first movie after hitting the big time with Mean Streets, and his fourth feature film. Quite un-Scorseseish as this movie is a sensitive human drama, rather than a violent crime-drama, and the lead character is a woman. Scorsese proves to be a reasonably good hand in this genre though, producing a movie that is warm and engaging. Funny at times too - the scenes with Vera were Chaplinesque in terms of physical comedy. Performances are generally good. Ellen Burstyn is great as Alice and Alfred Lutter is, for the most part, very good as Tommy. The scenes with Alice and Tommy are great and are a highlight of the movie - wonderful interactions. Burstyn won a Best Actress Oscar for her efforts. Kris Kristofferson puts in a solid performance. On the negative side, Harvey Keitel is irritating in his role. The movie also features an 11/12-year old Jodie Foster in a reasonably important role. Two years later she would appear in Scorsese's next film, Taxi Driver... Not a perfect movie though - far from it. There are times when things get clumsy, even silly. In addition, some aspects of the plot and character development aren't too consistent.

Granted, the directors 'cannibalized' Terry Gilliam, as well as the Coen brothers and David Lynch, to name but a few, but the design, action and camera movements reveal a personal style. The content - a clown (Pinon) falling in love with the innocent short-sighted daughter (Dougnac) of a butcher (Dreyfus) whose greatest delicacy is human flesh - is subjugated to the style, the insistency of which becomes rather wearisome at times.

I am not sure if Jeunet & Caro are Coppola's 'children', there is no doubt however that they are Buster Keaton's grandchildren. And something that helps to push them way up in cinematography-expertise: they think and write film, even in the very first stages where the film is just a handful of ideas. Where Coppola had the ultimate star of film-making beside him on several occasions, the Vittorio Storaro of Caro & Jeunet for this picture (and Alien 4) is the wonderful cinematographer Darius Khondji (Se7en; The Ninth Gate), which completes a team of visionaries that made an absolutely sensational film !!",0.0

It knocked me over, left me breathless, gave me what author/ critic/ scholar/ philosopher/ spiritualist CS Lewis calls a stab of Joy. It is that feeling of pure, unperverse warmth (not to confused with pleasure which can get guilty) that errupts something takes your fancy. Not that I can describe it half as good as that fellow. I think MONSTER'S INC is one of the best movies ever made. Best animated movie, though. Should have taken the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, but Shrek is good enough to get away with it. Unlike Shrek, which is silly yet deep(I own it on DVD, so don't complain), Monster's Inc builds more on character developement and scenario than pop-culture references (it has a few, though). This movie took me away into the World of Monstropolis. I was practically one of the characters (I have two eyes, in case you were wondering). I just can't understand how anyone could NOT like this movie. A work of art!",0.025
5214,"A great movie.; Oh God!, is a  smart and funny film.  It is truthful, without being condescending.  It talks about religion without being religious.  It also showcases George Burns' finest screen appearance aside from The Sunshine Boys. As, God, Burns is astonishing.  Whenever John Denver asks questions that every being would ask if confronted by God, Burns replies with a certain, common sense, matter of fact response.  There is no grandiose answer.  One of my favorite lines is when John Denver's character asks ""Why me?"", God says, ""Why not you?  You know those supermarket things, every one millionth customer.  Or whoever crosses the bridge at a certain time.  Well you're the one millionth customer."" Speaking of Denver, he also is great, playing Jerry, not as a crazed man, but as an average grocery market assistant manager who is suddenly faced with the fact that God has chosen him to carry a message.  He plays his character with a certain warmth, and naturalness. Carl Reiner directed this film, and with a great eye.  Notice how Jerry's everyday life is just that, everyday.  The way he is with his wife, and kids, and people around him.  I've seen it a dozen times, because that's how people actually act.  Reiner brought a sense of realness to this movie, which in effect brought with it believability. ",0.0
1246,"Perfect movie for growing teens; I recently re-watched this film at my current ripe age of 30. I haven't watched this movie since the mid 90s when I watched it on TV. So that puts about 10-12 years since I've last seen it. I rented this movie because I recalled that it made such an impression on me. After watching the film again, I can remember why. The protagonists are a group of impressionable teenagers who are about to enter college. This is the age at which I saw this film. Robin Williams' character, Keating, is introduced as a teacher of poetry but becomes a teacher of life. His lessons of carpe diem (""seize the day""), living life to its fullest and nonconformity are the types of messages that ring true in the hearts and minds of teenagers. At this age, I find the film pleasurable but when I watched it at the time, I felt truly inspired. It was the sort of film that really made me think and feel and the general ideas sat with me for some time.",0.0

1148,"highly enjoyable; 'Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers' is a highly enjoyable claymation tale about an inventor man and his dog companion, who happens to be smarter than the man himself. This tale involves a rogue penguin with an evil plan involving Wallace and Gromit and his inventions. This is a warming tale about friendship and realistic characters, and children are sure to enjoy the imagination behind the story and the claymation and humour. Adults are also sure to love the same on a higher level. It's rare in a film to find a tale enjoyable to both children and adults, but 'The Wrong Trousers' succeeds in this. This is a charming little short film, and it should be watched and enjoyed by all. Highly recommended.",1.0
1175,"Amazing but not to all tastes!; This is one of the weirdest and most original films I have seen in a very long time. The film is about a post-apocalyptic future, though the future looks an awful lot like France circa 1950 (as well as having burned out hulks of buildings and the sky is brown). The set design and costumes look very much like the future world of Terry Gilliam's film, BRAZIL. It is supposed to be the future but the design is purely rooted in the past--as if on some alternate reality Earth. In this dystopic world, there isn't much to eat and society has disintegrated. The film is all set in and around a dilapidated apartment building where the tenants all survive thanks to the landlord--who butchers newcomers for the consumption of all!! Despite being a very dark subject, this cannibal fantasy is actually quite funny and charming (that is, apart from when they are hacking the unsuspected into cutlets). Into this sick micro-society comes a rather homely man, Louisan--the next unsuspecting victim. Now that I think about it, this film abounded with strange looking cast members--as if Fellini somehow were involved with the project. However, the landlord's daughter falls for this new guy and is determined to do her best to help this poor guy to escape--even if it means enlisting the aid of the dreaded troglodytes! As you no doubt can tell from the summary, this is one weird and original film. However, had the film not been done with such a light and comedic touch, it would have been yet another schlocky teen blood-feast films. But with the tongue in cheek attitude and lots of wonderfully dark little vignettes, the film is remarkably charming--even if it is about cannibals. Exceptionally well written, amazing visuals (you can't help but be riveted) and a wonderful freshness make this a very enjoyable treat. However, because of the subject matter, I am sure this sick film won't be to everyone's taste! Also, because there are so many clever and small little touches to this film, it sure bears repeated viewing so you can catch it all.",0.0
38038,"Excellent family flick!; A very cute movie!!! Well made with some hidden adult humor, but not in your face with it!! I must say I was very entertained and pleased with the script and humor in the movie. If you liked the little jokes the Chicken Run offered, then The Curse of the Were Rabbit will be right down you alley! Some jokes are pure English, but the cool claymation animation is a trip down memory lane and I, for one, am pleased to see it! Be prepared to have a theater full of kids which will increase the noise, but it's worth it because of this delightful little movie made me giggle all the way through it!!! The tongue and cheek delivery of all the voice actors is noticeable and they want you to laugh along with them as the lines are delivered!

4886,"Now here's a story children and adults can relate too.  Monsters in the closet.; While monsters in the closet may seem to be a scary reality for some children, `Monsters, Inc.' makes it light hearted by showing them it's all in a night's work.  The characters are as charming as the cast that speaks for them. It's a learning experience children get to see how an industry works. Monsters, Inc. is an in-genius corporation that has scientifically learned how to channel children's screams into energy that is used for electrical power.  It has monster employees, an assembly line of doors (which give monsters access to children's bedrooms), a top-flight training program and some of the top Monsters in the scaring business. There's a colorful Metropolis, filled with houses, buildings, businesses, cars and everything that makes a city run smoothly along with a population of colorful creatures.  One of the colorful groups of creatures is the yellow swat team.  Their job is to protect the Metropolis of Monsters, Inc. from human contamination. But what happens when a human child mysteriously gets through the bedroom door and terrorizes the city with screams and boo's.  It's wondrous and funny.  In the mist of all this is industrial crime, brought on by greed. But, the story ends on a very happy note. John Goodman is the voice of `Sulley' a colorful large blue-green ape like monster who's the star Monsters, Inc. employee.  He's some type of monster, cut, cuddly, and he has a conscience that leads him to feelings of regret about scarring children.  He becomes attached to Boo (voice of Mary Gibbs) a cute, little big-eyed girl who is mysteriously brought to Monsters, Inc. and in his quest to return her home becomes very attached to her. Sulley's best friend is Mike (voice of Billy Crystal) who's a funny looking green ball with stick legs and one huge eye.  His comedy is seen through out the movie.  Mike is Sulley's driving force, acting as his agent.  Mike's job is to make sure Sulley remains the top Monsters, Inc. employee. But when it comes to laughter Mike proves he's on top. Mike's girl friend Celia (voice of Jennifer Tilley) is the stylish employee who has Mike's best interest at heart.  Her job is to keep him out of trouble. I give Monsters, Inc. a ten.  It is an animated movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family.  It makes for great family fun.",0.025
4388,"A Weak Storyline Filled With Constant Hilarity; Since the first Scary Movie completely ripped off Scream, at some points scene for scene, the film had a very developed, rich storyline which was filled with tons of hilarious gags. Half of that works in the sequel.  The storyline is weak, mainly copying the plot of the lackluster ""The Haunting"" which leads the main characters to spend a weekend in a haunted house.  This is a great idea, but the story is not developed enough and after watching the film, I couldn't even remember why the characters ended up in the house in the first place. Yet, the film's cast and writers give constant hilarious moments to add to the weak storyline and make a great film. Anna Farris returns as Cindy Campbell and is just as hilarious as she was in the first film.  Other returning members are Shawn Wayans as Shorty, Regina Hall as Brenda, and Marlon Wayans as Ray. There are several other new cast members, such as Tori Spelling, who does a tolorable job as a fellow college student, Alex.  Several other cast members make the film enjoyable and the gags are hilarious.  This is a great movie to see, because it's short and just something to laugh about, so fork over the nine bucks and laugh your ass off.",0.0
4388,"Tired re-hash of the first movie; The first movie, ""Scary Movie"" was a guilty pleasure.  Unfortunately, the second movie, ""Scary Movie 2"" was an unrelenting disappointment.  Whereas in the first installment, I was laughing at almost every joke, gag, and example of gross-out humour; in the second installment, it quickly became tired and worn. The Wayans Family franchise is talented, with brothers: Keenan Ivory, Shawn, Marlon, Damon and sister, Kim.  However, their involvement with this latest comedic offering proves that one can indeed go to the well once too often. The scriptwriting attempts to parody all the most popular movies from the ""Exorcist"" to ""Charlie's Angels"".  The question begs to be asked, ""How original is it to make fun of ""The Matrix""?""  The straightforward answer is ""not very"" when it is done repeatedly. Keenan Ivory Wayans had the responsibility to bring his interpretation of the script to the screen.  Many times, the director of a film can save it from a mediocre script.  This time the effort fell miserably short.  The timing between scenes lagged and film seemed excruciatingly long.  The movie did not flow properly and appeared disjointed.  It can be compared to a jigsaw puzzle that is assembled in no particular order. There is a consolation, the Director of Photography, Steven Bernstein, is a respected cinematographer in the film industry, with a best-selling book titled, ""Film Production"".  At least, the scenes were established correctly and the details were accurate for the shooting of the film. Finally, the ensemble comedic cast is a fine collection of talent.  It included the likes of a reptilian-like Tim Curry to an even more slimy James Woods, with his $1,000,000 cameo appearance fee.  Sadly, try as hard as they may, the laughs were forced from the audience.  The gross-outs scenes received the most guffaws from my fellow audience members, but the chuckles were soon followed by groans of disgust.  The reason was that the jokes were milked for too much mileage on the laugh-o-meter. In conclusion, the movie's promoters did an excellent job in marketing the sequel to the first film.  The timing is impeccable, ""Scary Movie 2"" quickly followed onto the heels of its predecessor, ""Scary Movie"".  The second movie has quietly grossed over $60 million domestically in the U.S. , this compares favourably to its initial production budget of $45 million.  With overseas boxoffice and video sales, it will either break even or make a small tidy profit for its producers. All other issues aside, if you as the moviegoer want to see more re-cycled content of the same in ""Scary Movie 2"" as in the first, ""Scary Movie"", go. Conversely, if you were satisfied with the first ""Scary Movie"" don't bother to go see the sequel.  Save your 8 bucks and go see another movie.",0.0
8838,"Someday Scorsese will get his respect.; Although frequently hailed as America's greatest living film maker, some could argue that Martin Scorsese still does not get the respect he deserves. Alice doesn't Live here Anymore isn't the same kind of flashy, attention grabbing film as it's predecessor Mean Streets (1973) or Scrosese's Alice follow up Taxi Driver (1976), this finds Scorsese in a rare thoughtful mood, offering the female flipside to Travis Bickle's male show of emotion. But Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore is just as good as those two films. It shows Scorsese's ability to take on a very simple project, and through his talent and urge to experiment, make it something that seems very fresh and very exciting. Take for instance the fantastic opening, a badly dubbed, red tinted play on an old studio film. Then we are brought into the film with a blistering crane shot down the street and to the window of a non-descript suburban home. The plot should be boring, nothing much happens for a while, but thanks to Scorsese's energy we can't stop watching, he manages to make us care about the characters. But he's not alone, he's helped by probably one of America's greatest actresses Ellen Byrstyn, she makes Alice a desperate, funny, lonely, independent, yet still pathetic character, that's what's so great about this film, all the characters are so brilliantly three dimensional. Plus there's wonderful support from the always-reliable Harvey Kietel, Diane Ladd, and the youngsters Alfred Lutter and Jodi Foster. The only let down of the film is Kristofferson, he really didn't have the talent for such an important role, one can't help thinking that perhaps they should have had Kietel and Kristofferson to switch roles, that might have worked better. I think one of the reasons Alice is so forgotten is because of the brilliance of Taxi Driver; it completely over shadows this small little film. Or maybe because it's a little to dependant on characters for today's audiences, that ending just wouldn't fly with the Pearl Harbour/Sixth Sense crowd of today's multiplexes. Any way I would recommend any fans of thoughtful seventies cinema to seek out this great film immediately, and see one of the best films from America's greatest living film maker, and most underrated actress. 8/10",0.0
38038,"Entertaining and well worth checking out.; The upcoming vegetable competition is proving to be an obsession for the villagers, including the wealthy Lady Tottington, but is in danger from an explosion in the rabbit population. Fortunately Wallace the inventor and his dog Gromit have a new sideline in pest control, but Wallace pushes his luck too far when he hatches a plan to eradicate the rabbit threat for good. This latest extravaganza from Nick Park's Aardman Animations is the 4th outing for Wallace and Gromit, their first full-length film following on from the success of Chicken Run. Though most animation films now use CGI, Aardman have thankfully stuck to their Plasticene roots. This medium has some definite advantages over CGI, such as the ability to employ natural light. The film is resolutely old-fashioned, and makes few concessions to international audiences. This is the world of 1950's England, reflected in the dialogue and accents, as well as the characters of the villagers, many of whom wouldn't look out of place in an Ealing comedy. Gromit on the other hand resembles a silent movie star, able to convey an amazing range of emotions through his eyes. Comparing Were-Rabbit to Wallace and Gromit's earlier adventures, the film most closely resembles A Close Shave, substituting rabbits for sheep, and having a similar love sub-plot. The film's main challenge was to extend its plot over more than 80 minutes. It occasionally feels slightly stretched and some of the twists are ridiculous even for this series, but on the whole it achieves a remarkable level of success. Overall the film doesn't reach the standard of The Wrong Trousers, but it's very entertaining and well worth checking out.",1.0
4886,"Monsters University teaches zombies how to Heat the box office.; For the second straight week, Monsters University takes home the box office winning again over World War Z. This time the winning team Disney/Pixar made $46 million in the U.S. for an impressive total $171 millions in two weeks. The Heat, with Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy, took second place with $40 millions in its debut week. Brad Pit and his zombie flick only could make third with $29 millions, leaving zombies wanting for more. It is a bit of a surprise that WWZ is doing so modest in the box office in spite of all the publicity and marketing. But in the other hand, maybe we can think of summer as the reason for this overturn to the Max Brook's book film version. In my visit to the theater to watch the second installment of the Monsters Inc 2001 film, the audience was almost all kids with one or two parents. This maybe made it easier for the animated film to make more money in the U.S., as long as kids are in summer break and parents are willing to sacrifice themselves for them; or shouldn't I have called it sacrifice? Pixar Studios, in my opinion, have found the formula to create stories that could entertain both kids and parents at the same time. To name some: Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and the most recent Toy Story 3. Story lines well told, impeccable animation, comedy and a lot of the Disney Magic is what makes these films so attractive to all audiences. Monsters University belongs to this category. The animation of the campus is absolutely beautiful. Screenwriters, Dan Scanlon and Daniel Gerson, recreated the before lives of Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan in a smart way. But the story line that for me was more relevant was the bullying that Wazowski was victim of. This is a theme that in the U.S. public opinion is being trending for the past years, so it was not difficult to feel related to easily. So for the rest of the story, I won't make more explaining in order not to spoil the movie to those who have not seen it yet. But I have to say that any person, who has had the experience to attend any classroom of any type, will enjoy this film. Also the performances of Billy Cristal (Mike) and John Goodman (Sullivan) were pleasant to the ears. It felt like it hasn't been 12 years since Monsters Inc., and more impressive is that they were portraying those characters voices in their younger spirits. Thumbs up to these good actors. By far, Monsters University belongs to the elite group of sequels (and in this case prequel) that have made a presentation that it's original and yet keep the essence of its previous one. Also, it could become one of the most successful movies for the team Disney/Pixar, even though is quite a hard task to beat the incredible $1,064,404,880 box office score of Toy Story 3 worldwide gross. Nevertheless, while we wait for that to happen, what we can say for sure is that zombies are not happy by the fact they have been beaten by two chicks in a cop flick, and by monsters that were meant to scare kids but that have been heating the numbers for two weeks in a row. Five stars to Monsters University make me say that it is mandatory for parents to take their kids to see it. And for those who enjoy the Disney magic, in this case seasoned with the Pixar originality, please don't miss this change to be entertained with a good movie.",0.025
1246,"Intriguing male version of ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" (major spoilers ahead); Anyone familiar with the Muriel Spark novel ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" or the film of the same name will easily spot parallels with this 1980s Robin Williams picture, in which he plays an idealistic English teacher who inspires his pupils to greatness. The setting has been updated into an exclusive rural American boys school, where the pupils are made to swear by the ethos of ""Tradition, Honour, Discipline, Excellence."".  In walks John Keating (Williams), who introduces a radical approach to educating his pupils that clashes with the staid traditionalism of the school, a process which eventually leads to tragedy... The film is without a doubt exceptionally well made.  It is very well shot, acted and directed and is a consistent pleasure to watch.  The main problem is with the storyline and characters, both of which remain quite cliched and don't possess ambiguity or depth.  With the exception of Keating (and a slightly liberal-minded colleague) virtually all the adults are harsh and repressive with no explanation as to why they are this way, or why they stick so rigidly to their positions.  Only a few of the boys in Keating's class are given much personality, and the rest are filler characters whom we learn very little about.  Rounding them all out would have maybe taken longer, but would have made the film more interesting. The film's main strength is the actors.  Ethan Hawke's Todd and Robert Sean Leonard's Neil get the lion's share of the screen time as Keating's two chief pupils, and they make the most of it.  Hawke is a lonely young man neglected by his rich parents, and Leonard is a sensitive creative soul with a frustrated passion for acting.  Both actors clearly depict the thin line of tragedy running through these spoiled young boys very well. Of the adults, Kurtwood Smith is on fine form as Neil's tyrannical father.  Alas, his part is that of the standard mean old father and he's never given any background.  Nevertheless, Smith really makes the audience hate him within his limited amount of screen time yet when he tells his son to become a doctor not an actor, you can't help feeling he has a point. Make Miss Jean Brodie a man while removing her fascistic undertones and you have the essence of John Keating.  The problems with the character are the same with all the others, yet Williams overcomes these and makes Keating a sympathetic, passionate and likeable man.  The film livens up whenever he is onscreen. In conclusions, ""Dead Poets Society"" is a very sophisticated, well acted film.  Regardless of the lack of depth, it remains an enjoyable film experience.",0.0

There's something truly endearing about these two characters. Like getting home after work, slipping on a comfy pair of slippers and tuning into to your favourite programme with a refreshing sup on the hot, brown liquid stuff. As in the other shorts it's Gromit the ever faithful mute dog that steals the film from the gormless but lovable Wallace. How Park and co. get to convey such emotions from him never fails to amaze me. You can easily see why it took them five years to produce, as ever stop motion gem is faultless, except for the odd missed thumb print on the character's heads. The script is well conceived and the sight gags are genius. This is a film that will delight both young and old audiences alike. A hearty recommendation. Can't wait for the DVD.",1.0
6773,"Triumph of the Retro; If you love the style of the old Chuck Jones cartoons, or the Pink Panther, you'll definitely love this movie. If not, you may love it all the same. The animated characters are entertainingly Â– and artistically Â– grotesque, with understated emotions. They say it all with a barely noticeable shift of the eye or by fixing their glasses, or just by staring ahead. And yet understatement is the characters' chief strength, and for once we have an animated film that doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence. Call it retro if you like, but it is very effective. Machines and houses can be just as grotesque as people in this movie: ships that look like they should rightly sink into the water like a knife, houses arched back subserviently under pressure from elevated railways, and a fat Statue of Liberty (just a hint as to how Americans are treated in this movie Â– but it is done without any malice). Nothing makes sense when viewed individually, and yet together it meshes into a true masterpiece of form and content. The storyline is very simple: a French bicycle racer is being kidnapped by the French Mafia to be used for illegal gambling, leaving his grandmother to try and rescue him. Along the way she teams up with the aging Triplets of Belleville, who, no longer at the heights of their power, still have a trick or two up their sleeve. But if all you're after in a movie is a strong story, you might be disappointed. The accent here is on superb animation and soundtrack, which creates a feast for the eye and ear (speaking of ears, it will be a while before you'd be able to get that tune out of your head). This makes the movie watchable more than once Â– you will only enjoy it more on subsequent viewings. Bruno the dog also deserves a special mention: though grotesquely fat, it is probably the most true-to-life and well-developed depiction of a dog in any movie, filmed or animated. No cutesy stuff here, just real ""dogginess."" His dreams are especially interesting and add a surrealistic dimension to an already part-surrealistic production. This movie should be a household name. Pity we're not more open to foreign films: most of us keep missing out on masterpieces like this.",0.027777777777777776

66097,"Exceptional, but probably not for younger viewers; CORALINE is an exceptional movie and I really have to admire the folks who made it. However, I should point out that this is NOT a movie for younger viewers because the movie is basically like walking into a nightmare. I think I'd be very hesitant to take a child younger than 10 to see it--it is that dark and scary. When the film begins, you are blown away by the amazing stop-motion film work. I assumed it must have been computer generated, but amazingly the film was made using models and figures with interchangeable features. It is many generations beyond the old Rankin-Bass animation or even ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (also by the folks who brought us CORALINE). The artistry was amazing and so many little details and touches made the film look magical. In addition, I found a theater where it was shown in 3-D and I really think it's well worth the extra money to get the three dimensional experience because it was flawless. The story is about a young girl who is unhappy. Her family just moved into a weird old Victorian era home but the parents are so busy with their job that they don't have much time for poor Coraline. Later, however, Coraline discovers an alternate world--one where everything looks a lot like the real world but seems perfect--so perfect that she'd rather live there. However, being a scary story, things of course aren't as they seem and this leads to a confrontation that could spell doom for the girl and her parents. Excellent all around and I have no serious complaints. A very good film for older kids, teens and adults....but not little kids, as the film will probably scare them out of their wits. Don't let the PG rating fool you--this is NOT like a Disney or Nickelodeon film but more like an even more intensely dark Roald Dahl story done in stop-motion. Neil Gaiman is the author of this tale and my daughter read his story and the film and although they were different here and there (the film adds Wybie, for example), she said both were equally wonderful.",0.0

And, to a large extent, it very much still does. In this second TV outing for the lovable plasticine pair, Gromit receives an extraordinary birthday present- a pair of ex-NASA, giant mechanical trousers! But the pair have hit hard times financially, with large bills to pay and so the only solution, seemingly, is to hire out a lodger. Enter a small tiny penguin, the biggest menace of such a creature to hit a screen since Batman, a seemingly innocent guy who is kind to Wallace and forces poor Gromit out the way. But his real plans are far more sinister: he means to pull off a diamond heist from a local museum and use Wallace and his extraordinary trousers to do it. Gromit discovers this while snooping around, and sets out to stop it. Of all the shorts, as I said, this one is my personal favourite. The story just flows along the smoothest and is the most engaging, even if Wallace is the only speaking presence. But this is not a problem, as Gromit's facial expressions are more impressive than anything he'd say ever could be. Without saying anything, he pulls off the film's most funny and even endearing and touching parts. The penguin is a marvellously sly and cold villain, never humorous and always with an air of menace about him. Nick Park and Steve Box have here created the best of their weird and wonderful world where humans and animals seem to amiably and inexplicably co-exist. The dog's bol1ocks, not to put too fine a pun on it. *****",1.0
50005,"Outstanding...; This movie has gotten a lot of bad remarks but I think it was simply because of the few action scenes and martial arts in it but this movie, in my opinion, had more realistic fighting for it didn't have all the hopping around and jumping and floating/flying in midair, i.e Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Hero but I still love those film. This on the other hand was MUCH different. First off, the setting was stunningly beautiful. This film did a great job of capturing a mood and it sometimes made you feel you were there in that palace. You had a sense of what it was like living in that time period and what the environment was like. The art and everything else. I think it really paid off for this film. As for the acting, I LOVED it. Everyone did a great job. I don't think critics should judge these actors if they're not one themselves because the cast was brilliant. You had sympathy for each and every one of them, even if they were evil, idiotic, or down right crazy. The Empress was very good with her illness. The scenes where she was having these nervous breakdowns, when she shook, you sort of shook with her. God, it was making you crazy seeing her that way and she was taking it all in. She knew what was happening to her and something inside was just burning and wanting to scream out but she couldn't because the Emperor was in control and didn't allow disobedience. The first son and his intimate relationship with his step mother and blood sister was very interesting. It was this sick disturbing twist put into the story you think ""why the hell did they do that?"" but it was thrilling. Him and his sister's reactions when they found out they were related were priceless. I think anyone would have ran out screaming mad as she did. The second son, you just had to love him. His devotion to dying for his mother was heart breaking and even more when he killed himself. I was rooting for him to live on but THAT didn't happen. Seeing him die just set the Empress off completely and she just snapped. She reacted as any modern human being would have to a loss of a loved one and in suffering from losing to the Emperor who was slowly killing her softly; she screamed out her pain. The last son, well, I guess you could pity him. He was ignored and what-not; all he wanted was some attention. His act was selfish although and not such a smart move. His father gave him a old fashion whipping but it was till his death. Not such a good way to go. Overall, this movie was great and it truly showed a dysfunctional family. So if you have issues in your home, I recommend you see COTGF. It might give you a better perspective of life.",0.0
1246,"Depressing, but one of my all-time favorites; I saw this movie in my English class two years ago. I fell in love with it. It's a tad depressing because of what happens, but there is some comic relief in the movie. It's one of the few older movies that is one of my favorite, or that I like. It's also one of two movies I saw in a class that I liked (the other one being one of the movie versions of ""Lord of the Flies""). Robin Williams is in one of his best roles as Mr. John Keating (aka 'O Captain My Captain'), and he was very inspiring to both boys and girls alike. Even though there weren't many female roles, I'm a female, and I adored this movie. So, in the words of Mr. Keating, carpe diem! Go rent this movie!",0.0
2302,"Dispensable, but really very funny !!!; This is not a thematically ambitious or layered film. It is a fairly surface level exploration of a 'fish out of water' situation. Vinny is a thoroughbred New Yorker who has suddenly been forced to visit and spend time in rural Alabama to get his cousin and his friend off a murder case. If that in itself doesn't make him feel out of place, the feeling gets intensified when he finds out how inept he is in terms of wrapping his head around the technical sides of being a lawyer. As aforementioned, the film doesn't make any effort to be anything other than an uncomplicated comedy and in terms of achieving its objective, it hits the bull's eye. Director Jonathan Lynn manages to perfectly capture the light-hearted tone necessary for the film and his comic timing in terms of staging and editing of particular scenes is great. Of course the script makes use of plot machinations and conveniences to join the narrative dots, but when I'm laughing and enjoying myself so much, those contrivances end up not mattering too much. One of the big reasons why 'My Cousin Vinny' was such a joyful experience for me was the acting. Both Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei are on fire. Pesci plays a character who retains some of the stereotypical Italian-American tropes of Tommy from 'Goodfellas', but he tweaks his eccentricities just enough to make Vinny seem funny and likable instead of looking like a psychotic killer. Tomei is an absolute dynamite in every scene. Her heightened facial gestures and Brooklyn accent along with her pitch perfect timing make it impossible for the viewer to not break out in laughter on multiple occasions. The chemistry between Pesci and Tomei is essential for the film to work. Fred Gwynne needs to be admired too for his role as the overbearing Judge Haller. He plays a perfect foil for Vinny during the courtroom scenes and their exchanges are laugh out loud funny. 'My Cousin Vinny' is not an 'important' film from a filmmaking standpoint. It isn't offering any profundities, philosophies or messages. All it wants is to make the viewer laugh, and it achieves that feat tremendously well.",0.0

38038,"Superb. One for the Kids and their parents.; I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I wasn't sure at first if the material could stretch from the usual short film lengths to a full blown feature film but I needn't have worried. The trademark Wallace and Gromit humour was there in abundance and lots of in jokes for the adults that would be over the heads of most kids. The voice acting is fantastic and am very pleased to see one of my favourite British Comedians (Peter Kay) doing one of the voices.. although I didn't think he had much to say and his own brand of humour didn't shine through.. but then the film wasn't about him was it? Don't just take my word for it. Go to the movie with the kids, go again by yourself, go with your significant other. You'll love it. I did",1.0
38038,"Laugh out loud funny!; In 1989 the animated duo, Wallace & Gromit debuted to instant success. The short films ""The Wrong Trousers"" and ""A Close Shave"" earned creator Nick Park an Academy Award in 1993 and 1995! This year, their first feature film hit the big screen, WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT. When the town's vegetables are being mysteriously devoured in the night, inventor Wallace, and his canine partner Gromit, come to the rescue. Their 'Anti-Pesto SWAT Team' is on the case and on the trail of this enormous beastly rabbit that is terrifying the town's inhabitants! The love interest in the movie, Lady Campanula Tottington, is voiced by Helena Bonham Carter, and Wallace's arch nemesis, Victor Quartermaine, is voiced by none other than actor Ralph Fiennes. Carter was the voice of Johnny Depp's bride in Tim Burton's animated film Corpse Bride that came out last year. The gadgets and gizmos that Wallace and Gromit use are imaginative and ingenious. From their daily life, to the mechanisms they use in attempting to catch the fluffy monster, you are in for a wild ride with these two endearing characters! The rest of the film is packed with memorable characters as well, with zany voices and facial expressions that combine to be laugh out loud funny! The creators of this Wallace & Gromit feature, also created the successful hit Chicken Run, which was released back in 2000. This new film is just as memorable, with an equally entertaining story that adults and kids can enjoy. The claymation is astoundingly good, and in these days of computer animated features, its refreshing to see something real and fleshed out in clay moving before your eyes. The manpower that went into creating this 85-minute film was great, with progress slow and work tedious. Many comparable films are created on a computer grid, with keystrokes and mapping, but this was created the old fashioned way - with sets and pieces being manipulated manually through countless hours of physical labor! The final product is visually impressive, and will keep you smiling and laughing the whole way through. This vegetarian horror film is alongside Disney's CARS as one of my favorite animated films of 2006. Laughter is the best medicine, so be sure to put this on your list of antidotes.",1.0
6773,"This film is the most imaginative lampoon of 2 societies in at least a decade.; When does strange become entertaining? When does satire become art? When does cartoon eclipse film? It all happens in writer/director Sylvain Chomet's French Canadian `The Triplets of Belleville.' Bypass your Burton (Tim, that is) and discover that this film is the most imaginative lampoon of 2 societies in at least a decade, maybe forever. The French live on a diet of frogs; Americans eat anything.  The French love bicycling (Think Tour de France); Americans love to watch them loving it.  Both the French and the Americans are prone to exploit the culture for fun and profit. The plot is simple compared with the mise en scene. Grandma pursues crooks who have abducted her bicycle-racing grandson for gambling purposes.  The Triplets will be instrumental in helping grandma look for him.  Along the way we'll see Frenchmen dynamiting for frogs and Americans adoring a voluptuous, overweight Statue of Liberty. Chomat and company have layered so much pop-culture in with sociological profiling in `Triplets' that one must see the film several times to catch all the cross references (e.g., Don't miss the framed poster of `Mr. Hulot's Holiday,' the auto licenses expressing `In Vino Veritas,' or the frog-sicle!). The look is unique: a hand-drawn, digital combination of `Betty Boop,' `Felix the Cat,' and `Return of the King.'  The jazz score delivers the right tone of hip and haste. The style is more `South Park' than `Toy Story.'  If it were a documentary it would remind you of `Capturing the Friedmans' and ""American Splendor."" Have those witty French framed a narrative skewering American culture's ravenous profit mongering and egregious eating?  Yes, but it does fry the French as well. Although there is almost no dialogue, there is something for any imagination that tips like grandma's house to the left. ",0.027777777777777776

4388,"The Victims of the First Are Back For the Worst!; CONTAINS SPOILERS Our story opens at Hell House where a big party is going on. It was being held by the Voorhees family. Everything is going great, when the daughter of the family becomes posessed by the devil in an Exorcist fashion. They call upon Father Harris and Father McFeely. They try to get the devil out of her and have a green vomit spewing contest. They don't get anywhere very quick. Years later at college, the friends from the first Scary Movie, who were murdered in the movie, miraculously have returned for the sequel. There's Cindy, Ray, Shorty, Brenda and new guy, Buddy. Cindy has a crush on Buddy, but he just wants to be a jerk to her. Anyway, their professor, Professor, has chosen these guys for a project. To study insomnia he said at an assembly, which Shorty slept through. Professor and his assistant, Dwight who was in a wheelchair, set up cameras at the chosen place for the project, Hell House. They've even set up cameras in the shower for their own personal enjoyment. When Cindy arrives first, she meets the caretaker, Hanson. Hanson was a total creep-out with a deformed hand. He really made everybody lose their appetites when he served dinner. He put his hand in all the foods and basted the turkey with his tongue!         The house was haunted! The ghost of the original owner, Hugh, patrolled the house nightly looking for the spirit of his long, lost mistress. The picture of her looked remarkably like Cindy, only her hair had less split-ends, her skin wasn't as oily and her breasts weren't as pointy. Anyway, a giant plant rolls Shorty and actually smokes him! The friends must band together to stop this evil. Dwight sets up a contraption to blast it into oblivion. And that's pretty much our story. Now, I was disappointed with this film. I really liked the first Scary Movie, so I thought the sequel would be just as good. But it totally wasn't. They should've just stuck with one movie. But they're spoofing all the great horror movies, which all had sequels up the wazoo. I hear they're making a Scary Movie 3. It'll be out soon. But anyway, I strongly recommend you just see the first one. Don't even bother with this one. And there's sex jokes and crude humor up the wazoo! -",0.0
4388,"Disappointing Follow Up to a Good Movie; I was very disappointed by this movie.  I thought that ""Scary Movie"" although not a great movie was very good and funny.  ""Scary Movie 2"" on the other hand was boring, not funny, and at times plain stupid. The Exorcist/Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie.  James Woods was great. Now, I'll admit that I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first, where I had basically seen them all.  But bad comedy is still bad comedy. Something that really hurt this movie was the timing, which ruined some of what might have been good jokes.  Scenes and jokes drag out way to long. Also, the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again.  For example, the talking bird.  Ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time.  But it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying.  The routine between the wheelchair guy and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless. Some jokes even got repeated from the first movie.  For example, the 'creaming' I guess you would call it of Cindy (Anna Faris) was funny in ""Scary Movie"" because Cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long, that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he 'creamed' her.  But this time around it was out of place and not funny. The bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around.  The scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film. Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie. But I did enjoy Shorty (Marlon Wayans) who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film.  The scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film. Don't get me wrong, I love the Wayans family and their humor.  That is why this film is so disappointing . . . they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes.",0.0

4886,"a little too schmaltzy; contains some spolilers... If you can remember the days when you had to stand for `God Save The Queen', they had a half time and only one screen at your local cinema, you'll love Monsters Inc.  The fact it starts off with a digital cartoon short will take you back to the heady days when Warner Bros. cartoons were the stock standard introduction to any movie. Then you're thrown head long into the world of Monsters Inc., the company that provides electricity to the city of Monstropolis by collecting the energy generated by terrified children's screams.  The opening scene is pure genius, with a trainee scream collector as terrified of his victim as the child is of him.  But not all is what you think, with a nice twist thrown in right at the beginning. The best scream catcher at the factory is Sulley (John Goodman), who we meet as he prepares for his day's work under the watchful eye (pun intended) of his trainer and mentor Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal).  At the plant he's everybody's hero, while chameleon like monster, Randall Boggs is obsessed with knocking him off his perch. Things go awry when a small child enters the world of monsters.  The monsters are as terrified of children as children are of them, thinking that children carry terrible viruses that will destroy their hidden world.  But Sulley connects with the intruder, whom he names Boo, and decides it's up to him and Mike to save her.  That means getting her back through the closet door that will return her to the world of humans.  But it's easier said than done, with Randall and Monsters Inc. CEO, Henry J Waternoose, doing their best to banish Sulley and Mike while using Boo for their evil means. Telling you too much more would spoil the story, but I can tell you, that since Disney are involved, it has a happy ending. And that was the problem for me, not that I don't appreciate happy endings.  I found Monsters Inc. to be too schmaltzy for my taste.  The continual use of violins in the soundtrack became a little overbearing and were used as signposts to let you know that now was a good time to get emotional. Perhaps the writers should have taken note of their own story line - that children don't scare as easily any more.  A few more scares and less sugar would have made a world of difference.  It also lacked the wit of Shrek - perhaps the best animated feature this year? Now, please don't get me wrong and take it that Monsters Inc. is a bad movie; it's just that it could have been a lot better.  If you want to know what it could have been like, check out Real Monsters on Nickelodeon, a cartoon that has real wit for the adults and plenty of slapstick for the littlies. But when it comes to the perfect kids movie for over the school holidays, you couldn't go far wrong with Monsters Inc.  Children will love the delightful, almost cuddly monsters that aren't really scary at all.  The animation is of the highest standard, with everyone of Sulley's hairs lovingly rendered and attention to the smallest details making the movie life like. But perhaps the best thing about Monsters Inc. is that it will help your children realise that all those scary things that go bump in the night are just doing their job.",0.025

This isn't your run-of-the-mill remake animation, as this film is original and creative. It also is not what animation is usually for; cheerful cuddly characters performing antics and making viewers laugh. This animation talks about serious issue, hidden subtly in its presentation. It talks about how kids (and teenagers) usually dislikes their parents and their environment, and yearn for life different from what they have. They wanted something different, and they thought the grass is greener on the other side. In this animation, it is not always so. There are baits of 'better' life when actually it is reserved for something sinister. I like the spooky feel of this animation, the dark environment and the surreal set-ups. It is cleverly woven, with art-like precision to make this film a nice watch, whilst being spooky, not gory. I recommend this film to everyone who likes animation.

1175,"Connections; Most commentors on this marvel at the imagination, the adventuresome cinematography and the mix of black and humor. I found these amusing, but hardly interesting. What was interesting was how many ways the film explored human connection. Usually you get two: love (or some surrogate) and folded insight, connecting the movie to the viewer. Here you have: Â— eating one another and with each other Â— love of course, love in the romantic sense Â— sex (well, this is common too, but not usually divorced from love) Â— performing together (two ways) Â— conspiring together You have connections themselves by radio, TeeVee, performing, pipes and chutes in the building (about which much is made), and a repeated set of Rube Goldberg suicide mechanisms. String, yarn, boomerang knife. Postal packages. None of these make sense unless you believe they were put there to make sense. It is as if they decided first to make a film about connection, and then to place it in a threatening future, allowing filming tricks. I'm glad this guy went on to make at least one film after this that found coherence. Maybe we have to sit through some number of these sometimes to get a good film.

Then I saw it again and again, until it finally got to the point that I couldn't get enough of it. Sylvain Chomet has clearly put a lot of work into this movie and it shows throughout the entire movie. Even as strange as the characters and the animation is, it still looks very believable, and the bizarre humor shines beautifully. All I can say us the character, Bruno the dog, stole quite a few scenes with his hatred of trains, particularly the scene where they were eating frogs for dinner. In all I have to say this is a great movie, although I wouldn't recommend this for kids.

4326,"'Untouchables' meets 'Midnight Express' and 'Mockingbird'; Some spoilers... Funny how perceptions of movies change over time.  'Alien 4' has grown on me, 'Thin Red Line' has, 'Wizards' has, even 'Pink Floyd', but this one sank upon revisiting it. Parker's stuff is technically competent, I'll grant him that, and he has a decent grip on production values--which is more than I can say for most directors--but something wrong is afoot here.  I think Parker frequents the musical genre so he can pass off his razzle-dazzle style without worrying about filmic stimulation.  As compensation, he uses symbolism-loaded ""art"" images.  Watch when the Klan attacks the church, instead of Ollie Stone-style brutality, we get a 'Face/Off' music video. If you're into that sort of thing you'll love his work but I find it thuggish and sanitized (like 'Lord of the Rings').  Honestly, it's editor Gerry Hambling that's made Parker famous, nothing else. The story here is too simple, but get rather interesting when you see the Hoover-Vietnam-King connection.  Do some reading into that later.  Storywise, Parker's 'Wall' is better as it mixes past/present, real/fantasy, time/space into one crazy mix. Fortunately, the acting is interesting--Parker really got an unorthodox cast.  Each actor takes two characters to make a new knockoff.  Hackman takes his Doyle from 'Connection' and uses Connery from 'Untouchables'.  Dafoe does his Christ with Atticus Finch.  Dourif combines Piter deVries from 'Dune' with Barney Fife. Want some cinematic irony?  Compare this with 'Die Hard'.  Both involve terrorism, xenophobia, and some competent attempts at being cinematic with many elements (flying, explosions, height, night, claustrophobia).  Here the good white guys save the inactive Blacks from the bad white guys.  Boring.  At least McTiernan made things interesting: Black cop saves white cop from Nazis. Your favorite Parker will depend on your tendencies, but if you want intelligent Klan bashing, watch 'O Brother'.",0.0

1175,"The only movie I have watched 31 times on the big screen; Surreal, mordantly and morbidly hilarious, understated yet over the top, there simply are not words in the English dictionary to describe the effect this movie had on me. From the opening scenes of a crazed man wrapping himself in paper and hiding in the trash can to escape from the insane butcher through to the utterly crazed finale this is a movie like no other. Every part of the movie shines brighter than anything Hollywood has to offer. Cinematography, acting, direction are so perfect that I always forget that I'm watching a foreign language film and just get swept along with the delightful comic-book lunacy of it all - and I've watched this one so many times I know the script in French. Just read through all the reviews and see how often the word 'sublime' has been used. Then ask yourself how many other foreign language films people rave about to this extent. Whatever you may be expecting Delicatessen to be, it's all that and more. Watch this movie!",0.0
5540,"A large case of Gorgon-Zola makes for Cheezie fun!; For the last of his classic adventure sword and sandal films, Ray Harryhausen rounded up a cast of British and American film legends and turned what could have been a campy fiasco into a mesmerizing epic of Greek mythology. Yes, there are some falsehoods in translating the story of Perseus from Greek legend to Hollywood fiction, but oh, what a fun ride it is. Perseus (Harry Hamlin) is the grandson of a Greek Island king who angers Zeus by sending his daughter (who had the child out of wedlock with none other than the head of Mt. Olympus himself) out to sea in a huge crate with the infant future hero. Zeus takes his revenge, sending Poseidon to destroy the kingdom and years later, Perseus gets involved in the legend of the revenge of Zeus's sister on another kingdom whose princess (Judi Bowker) rejected the hand of her own son when Zeus turned him into a horribly deformed creature. Perseus steps up to the plate to win the princess for himself, taking on his evil cousin, giant scorpions, two-headed wolves and even the deadliest of Gorgons, Medusa herself. Opening with a fabulously epic score by Laurence Rosenthal, ""Clash of the Titans"" is mesmerizing from start to finish, and oh, what a cast. Handsome Harry Hamlin moved into leading man territory (before going ""straight"" into ""Making Love"") as the heroic Perseus and he does wonders with the part, being much more than just a pretty face and glorious body clad in nothing but a toga. Bowker is lovely and fragile without being cloying, and they are surrounded by a glorious cast of veterans in both Earthling and Greek God roles. Sir Laurence Olivier is totally grand as Zeus; Who else could have played this part (thank goodness Charlton Heston wasn't available!) without making it a huge ego fest? He commands every moment he is on screen, and it is without a doubt one of the crowning achievements of his later career. As his wife, Claire Bloom has little to do, but she does get in a few good lines. At least she isn't totally wasted as Ursula Andress is as Aphrodite. The curio for me is the opportunity to see Maggie Smith (as the Goddess Thetis) going up against Sian Phillips (""I Claudius's"" evil Livia). To see Phillips, whose character in the BBC mini-series set out to kill off everybody she could who stood in the way of her dreams to get her son on the throne of Rome going up against the glorious future Dame Maggie is a film lover's dream, and to watch Maggie literally loose her head as she tells off the vain Queen Cassiopea (Phillips) is a moment in film history that I cherished upon my first viewing and have memorized for my own moments of privately camping it up. Both women share that glorious voice that made them scene-stealers in everything they do, and to see these two legends working together (even if Smith in her scene with Phillips literally is a head of concrete) is glorious. Burgess Meredith totally hams it up as Hamlin's aged sidekick, making you both smile and roll your eyes at him at the same time. Veteran actress Flora Robson (who ironically played Livia in the ill-fated and uncompleted ""I Claudius"") is barely recognizable as one of the three witches Perseus faces during his quest to find the method of destroying the threatened danger on Bowker. However, when she does briefly get to speak, you recognize the voice who once cried over her ""wild, sweet Cathy"" in ""Wuthering Heights"". Fans quibble about the silly looking metal owl sent to protect Perseus, but the flying scenes with the magical horse Pegasus are certainly magical to behold. So if there are a few weaknesses in the film, they are more than made up for by the gems in the casting and most of the special effects which compared to the headache inducing remake are wonderful.",0.0
4886,"Wonderful animated movie!; This movie is just plain wonderful! Incredibly funny, told with a great tempo and with a lot of humour.  No dead moments at all!  The story is based on a single assumptions, that monsters in the closet are real, and that they scare little kids in order to get energy to power their city.  From this assumption, a wonderful story about a big threat to this lifestyle and kids everywhere is spun. On the visual nitpicking side, the computer animations are better than earlier attempts like Toy Story, but they are still somewhat deficient when it comes to humans. The hair on the main character Sulley is superb, and there is a wonderful sleighride scene with swirling snow that is exquisite! However, the humans are still doll-like, and the complexity of human hair has not been handled.  Most of the monsters look like slightly soft rubber, which is a bit disappointing... for some reason, it does not look quite right (except for the furry monsters). But the movie does not depend on the computer generated graphics to entertain, it would have been just as much fun if it had been handdrawn the old way.  Computer graphics allow for more dramatic pans and roller-coaster rides, and are good enough not to detract from the action, which is quality enough. Here in Sweden, there was a short movie about birds before the main movie, which was just wonderfully hilarious.  It would be very nice to see more of that kind; little animated movies are definitely fun before the main course!",0.025
6101,"How could an American journalist get lost in Chile?; Missing begins with journalist Charlie Hormon (played by John Shea) and his wife Beth (Sissy Spacek) spending time in Chile during the coup of 1973.  Charlie wants to get the big scoop and although the streets are muddled with dead bodies and tanks, he feels quite safe, and consoles Beth with the line ""They can't hurt us, we're Americans."" Needless to say Charlie turns up ""Missing"" and the majority of the film follows Beth and his father, Ed (Jack Lemmon), on a search for him.  During their search Ed finds himself dumbfounded by the corruption and bureaucracy he constantly comes across, not only of the Chilean government but also surprisingly of the one he trusted most, the American government. One may find this movie slow-moving if you don't really have too much background into the coup or are old-enough to remember some of the Cold War politics of the past.  You don't get to know Charlie well enough through the script to really care that he's missing.  These factors may add up to a dull movie for some viewers or it could motivate you to learn more.  The film rewards every viewer with great acting performances and a cool soundtrack by Vangelis.",0.0

Although there is a plot of sorts: an indomitable French Grandma with a clubfoot and her obese dog try to find her grandson who has been kidnapped from the Tour de France, this is a non-linear movie. Perspectives shift on whims. A pot of boiled tadpoles are transforms into the moon. The characters are all designed with extraordinary panache. They can express the most insouciant human emotions and melt away to nothing in the next instant. The jokes and are rapid -fire and the wit is delectable. Some art references: Tomi Ungerer, whole schools of sardonic European pre-WWII painters, Cocteau, Botero and the early masters of 20s and 30s cartoons, including early Mickey Mouse and Max Fleischer. The relentless movement of the film is underlined by Django Reinhardt-like, unsentimental hot jazz. There are very few recognizable words of either French or English.

1175,"Could Evoke the same sensation if it was purely visual; While I'm not a fan of the mixed genres that take priority of the screenplay in Delicatessen, the film does get a lot correct with style, mise-en-scene, framing, and direction. The coloring used for Delicatessen is scrumptious and makes for a viewing experience that could almost be purely visual. The directors, Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, control the film with a firm tone that carries the movie through its running time. The mise-en-scene the director captures with particular shots make Delicatessen memorable, starting with the opening shots consisting of circular objects of all sizes and shapes. The sound effects behind those opening shots are the sounds of knives, which identify food as the center of the film. The shot of the man in the garbage can, peering through the newspapers which he's wrapped in and the two mental cans he is inside is inventively cute and identifies the picture as a whole. The color pattern repeated the most frequently is the colors of red and green. The set, costumes, and lighting are saturated in these two blistering colors. Maybe the most memorable scene is when we cut between five different scenarios (a mattress being used, a violin being played, paint being swiped on a wall, a musical instrument being plucked, and knitting needles) using a specific amount of energy all of which collapse at the same time. The editing cuts like a knife between the different story lines and results in a well- crafted sequence. Rating: 7 Grade: B",0.0

2302,"Funny film; ""My Cousin Vinny"" proved to be a very funny movie. Just the idea of the plot, with an inept lawyer who finally passed the Bar exam having to win over his first case, is a great concept. Joe Pesci is as funny as he was in ""Home Alone"" several years before. Marisa Tomei, however (in her Oscar-winning performance), actually ends up stealing the show and becoming the most entertaining character in the film. Her New York accent and funny dialogue with great methods of delivery are hilarious, and I have to disagree with anyone who feels she did not deserve her Oscar. Some of the funniest material in the film is watching Pesci and Tomei try to adapt to the courtroom setting and the new town they are staying in. This is not monumental film-making, and it's not a perfect movie. The story takes a little too long to get going, and it's not until the end that the plot finally starts to build. Nevertheless, it's still a great way to spend a few hours, and this film is sure to entertain. *** out of ****",0.0

19,"Dumb, dumb movie...So what?; There is no doubt that both Ace Ventura-movies are simple, dumb movies with childish, gross-out and ""unintelligent"" humour.

Jim Carrey isn't always funny with his rubber-face and comedic acting, but Ace Ventura is THE role for him. Everything fits, and some parts made me laugh until I cried. Who can forget the car-scenes, the guano-bowls, talking with the tribe-people and most of all the scene with the monopoly-guy? If anyone who has seen it doesn't at least smile when watching that scene, I simply don't understand it.

4326,"Great Story Shows the Evils of Racism; Nowadays in post modern America, films that explore the thorny subject of race are not that uncommon, Crash and American History X being some prominent examples. However, simply because a movie has important subject matter that is treated in a politically correct manner does not make it a great film, something that the Academy has failed to grasp. Though Alan Parker's seminal work Mississippi Burning may not be as influential or culturally significant as To Kill a Mockingbird or In the Heat of the Night, the film stands out by putting racism in a classic good vs. evil battle that is %$$%^ compelling. The movie tells the story of three civil rights activists who were murdered in 1969 in Philadelphia, Mississippi and the subsequent FBI investigation that followed. Though the film is not completely accurate, the events and dialogue are no doubt believable if perhaps not in this exact context. The two lead FBI protagonists are wonderfully played by Gene Hackman and Willem Defoe, with special attention to Hackman as the former Southern small town sheriff who is disgusted with the culture of hate. The real highlight of the movie, however, is Brad Durruf's performance as the deputy sheriff head of the local Ku Klux Klan ""wrecking crew"" (the group that carried out illegal activities such as lynchings). Durrif is intense, committed, and fiercely intelligent, stopping at nothing to carry out the Klan's goals. Overall, the focus on making a good story makes it all the more effective at showing the evils of racism.",0.0
4326,"An Important Film about Racial Tension, Political Views and Humanity; Films that deal with civil rights issues can be a touchy subject and Alan Parker's 1988 film about true events was a firestorm for controversy. The film's dark subject matter about violence towards the African-American community in 1963 Mississippi remains an important part of shaped the eventual progress to equality for all races. The film tells the tale of two federal agents (Gene Hackman as Rupert Anderson and Willem Dafoe as Alan Ward) sent to the Deep South to investigate the disappearance of three civil rights workers (two African- American men and one Caucasian man). What the men find is the roots of corruption run deep in the town as the local lawmen and KKK members attempt to scare Anderson and Ward off, but their reserve steels the agents against the hate they constantly endure. As the leads, Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are the voices of reason among the judgmental and horrible characters in the small town their characters are investigating. Hackman plays the loose cannon officer who will bend the rules to get results while Dafoe is the by-the-books and ethical man, but later converts to Hackman's tactics after tensions boil to a breaking point between Anderson and Ward. The actors' chemistry is palpable as they play off each other in tandem from verbal sparring to their eventual physical confrontation, but without losing a mutual respect for how the other handles the investigation. The narrative is loosely inspired by the actual disappearance and murders of three civil rights workers (as depicted in the film's opening scene). However the movie delves into fiction for the majority of its run-time which does hurt the accuracy of the story. The inaccuracies however do not take away from the gripping power of the story as the movie is more focused on the inherent racism in the South during the 1960s. The movie's subject matter lent to controversy about the violence depicted against the black community, but the film scored Oscar nominations despite the criticism (however star Gene Hackman grew wary about films with such violence which caused him to withdraw from participating in ""Silence of the Lambs"" after he had bought the rights). Do not miss this film, it'll open your mind on what it was like back in an era of civil unrest.",0.0
1175,"Beyond Bizarre, Wickedly Entertaining Tidbit of a Movie; I'd put off seeing ""Delicatessen"" for a long time after hearing about it.  I'd heard it was a cinematically stylish dark comedy, and assumed it would be weighted down with ""significance"".  After having finally seen it, I kind of wish I'd come to it totally cold, since apart from the somewhat bleak setting and its wild, overwhelming climax there is nothing heavy about this movie. More stylish than profound, ""Delicatessen"" is not necessarily the movie its acclaim would lead some to believe.  (If it's the ""2nd greatest movie of all time"", ""Duck Soup"" must be the greatest.)  Though it takes place in a post-apocalyptic near-future, this setting only intrudes upon the film enough to give rationales to the characters' actions.  It's not so much a (post-) disaster movie as a comic romance, a twist on the ""traveling salesman meets farmer's daughter"" genre, populated by a more-than-usually-eccentric cast of supporting characters.  (The romantic leads are fairly quirky in their own right as well.)   The influence of Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"" is readily apparent, from the absurdly retro props and sets to the (literally, in this case) underground rebels.  At times, however, I was reminded even more of the Coen brothers' works; the ways the writing-directing team of Marc CaroÂ and Jean-Pierre Jeunet combine in-your-face cinematic style with an intricate, surprising plot, unusual characters, and a certain air of cheerful amorality should more than satisfy Coen addicts.  (There's even a dream sequence, a regular feature of Coen films.)  Since I'm totally unfamiliar with everyone in the cast, I won't presume to judge their performances except to hope that their post-""Delicatessen"" careers are doing well. Once again, despite its reputation this is a terrifically enjoyable (though unusual) light romantic comedy.  If you think you can stomach a certain amount of grotesquerie, ""Delicatessen"" should prove to be a satisfying cinematic tidbit.  (Apologies to those of you wondering why I've tiptoed around a particularly obvious plot point in this review.  Suffice to say that, in case someone reading this has through some mischance heard nothing of this movie, then I certainly don't want to be the one to give away its secret ingredient.)",0.0
66097,"The movie was just as good as the book; This is the first time I ever admit that a movie is just as good as the book. Don't blame me for always assuming that the movie tends to ruin the story, just look at the pile of examples, like Eragon, Harry Potter, Spiderwick, name others. While the book felt a little slow and melancholic, the movie felt quite upbeat and fun to watch, despite the dark setting. I enjoyed both as two different stories. The book, despite being slow, kept me wondering about what will happen next without falling asleep. The movie, on the other hand, still has Gaiman's Coraline, but has its own colours, and there were nothing left unexplained. I'm not going to babble about the detail of the story, but I might be babbling about some other movies for comparison, so please excuse me. Well, here's the thing, the reason why a movie could ruin the story is that too many scenes from the book were deleted and left unexplained, I mean, someone who haven't read the book can't actually enjoy it as it has holes from the original story. It's a trick, I suppose, so that the viewers want to read the book, but it could be backfired as well. People, who are disappointed with the movie might become unwilling to read the book, I'm one of those people. And then, here we have Coraline. I think everyone can enjoy it without ever having or willing to read the book the story based on. The plot was flawless and neat, even additional characters didn't look like sticker, everything blended in nicely and seamlessly that you might forgot that it was based on Gaiman's book. Overall, it was a really nice movie. Nice and imaginative plot, cute stop-motion animation (not to mention, neat), and safe for any ages.

2302,"Captured, Georgia; Well, this captures Georgia all right. Small-town Georgia, with its loblolly and slash pine forests and red clay earth, and its baked-brick buildings, and hard-charging justice system. The South in many ways is one of the most laid-back areas of the country; everybody's friendly-like, elderly neighbors visit newcomers and bring them home-made pies. But, don't laugh, it reminds me a bit of Inuit life. People can get away with quite a lot in a traditional Eskimo community as long as they generally stick to the norms. When they don't, they get killed. Not shunned, not fined, not chastized, not remonstrated with, not exiled -- killed. ""My Cousin Vinny"" is a movie that I find myself enjoying each time I watch it, although the story is simple enough and could easily be done poorly. Fortunately, given that the escapade depicted isn't by its nature hilarious, the picture is rather smoothly done, with advantage taken of every opporunity for humor. The underlying drama wears thin after the first viewing, but it's still filled with laughs. Joe Pesci can't help his presence seeming ridiculous, even in his heavy roles for Scorcesi. He simply SOUNDS funny. Marisa Tomei is slender and sweetly appealing. Her relationship with Pesci is a nice mixture of love, frustration, and resignation. She's smarter than he is, as well as much better looking. Fred Gwynn and Lane Smith are the local authority figures, judge and prosecutor respectively. But no one could accuse them of playing Southern stereotypes. The Judge is sharp, a Yale graduate and chess player, and allows no tomfoolery in his courtroom, although Pesci provides plenty of it. Smith, playing a Southern lawyer for the one-hundredth-and-fortieth time, is at least as good as he's ever been. Here, he's affable and full of principle, going out of his way to help Pesci and Mona Lisa find a quiet place to live. His roller coaster of an accent is a delight to listen to. And, like the others, he has some good lines. ""Verdict,"" he tells the jury in his summation, ""it means the truth. Comes down to us from our lil IL' ancestors in Europe,"" and the director gives us a brief shot of an African-American woman in the jury box listening intently. Ralph Macchio's part is rather small, which doesn't detract at all from the movie. He has one good moment. Interrogated by a sheriff, he thinks he's being arrested for stealing a can of tuna fish and knows nothing of the murder he's thought to have committed. He admits to the sheriff that, yes, in fact he stole the tuna. The sheriff says, ""Was that before or after you shot the clerk?"" There are about two exquisite seconds while Macchio continues staring straight ahead as this query sinks into his understanding, then he looks up as if doubting his senses, and says, ""I shot the clerk?"", which the sheriff immediately grasps as a straightforward confession. If you get a chance to see this, you might as well do so. I hope you can get the unexpurgated version so you can pick up on one of the films funniest exchanges after Pesci has repeatedly made a fool of himself in the courtroom. ""Counselor,"" says the judge, ""I'm holding you in contempt."" And Pesci mutters under his breath as he sits down, ""What the f*** else is new?"" Fred Gwynn's jaw drops and his expression of incomprehension has me smiling just thinking about it. It isn't a masterpiece of comedy, but it's a pleasant way to get through a few hours.",0.0

It pretty much is just an extension of a Wallace and Grommit style show. While some of the gags are mature this does not transcend beyond the kid age range. Some jokes are old, some are just dumb, many are corny and none are subtle, they very obviously had a forum and plonked in all the chicken puns they could. Some things are a little too harsh to appeal to all ages, mainly decapitating a terrified duck. The prison camp idea is not really explored well, though it has a million nods to 'The Great Race'. It also explores all trodden territory, like choosing to make an effort to get free, learning to cooperate with people you dont like, and going back on a profession that you dont care about someone, the kids love that stuff but older people yawn at it. Braveheart comes into it, the jokes based on it come off the funniest. The vocals don't credit Mel very much, nor the rest of the cast. The most likeable character in it is not Mel but the major who is the organised military presence. Basically if you liked Wallace and Grommit or child jokes and ethics in a disney cartoon time length then this is your flick, if you are looking for a Toy Story 2 quality appeal fest dont bother, for what it is I suppose, 7/10.",0.875
66097,"Amazing visual experience and a dark spell-binding story!; 'Coraline' is top notch movie magic, when it comes to creating a near perfect stop-motion animation picture. The animation is exciting, unique and full of life despite the really dark and Gothic tale. The story itself is well-written and really works on the screen (especially in 3D). The film deals with dark adult-like themes and references and it might scare the little ones, so it's defiantly not for the younger audience. Since that doesn't count for me I enjoyed it a lot and was actually blown away by this surprisingly little hidden masterpiece. So please people, open your eyes (or should I say door) and step into a beautiful universe that will capture your heart and soul and fill it with cinematic art at its finest. -Thanks for listening, AB...",0.0

6773,"Great drawings but a bit slow, for another generation maybe; The movie is slow to get to the point and would be appreciated best by people around 50-60. You need to know France after the World War II and the feeling of the Tour de France, ""Yvette a l'accordeon"", the mafia guys like ""armoires a glace"", the banana outfit of Josephine, the tap dancer, and so many more details. The music is great, drawings are great. It is like a good artistic comic. It is kind of a slow dark movie but it shows that with motivation you can go over the limits and of course the turtle still gets to the end of the race. This movie is in shades of grey. That's probably why I liked it. No black and white feelings, just life. Of course it has to be simplified since there is almost no word spoken.",0.027777777777777776
4388,"not much of a movie; Scary Movie 2 is really a disaster. It was obvious that this film was rushed, and badly edited. There are repeated jokes, and new ones that aren't very funny. The best moment is a spoof of Charlie's Angels, but even that is nothing special. There hasn't been anything this bad since Me Myself & Irene, a film from the Farrelly brothers who seem to just be getting more and more desperate. 1/4",0.0
38038,"So funny i was in tears, and was cute as well; The first thing that comes to mind is that this would have to be one of the funniest films ever. I am someone who had grown up watching the original 20-30 minute short films so I was really excited about this film. I guess I could see them making it from the moment I first saw the trailer for Chicken Run. And thank god they did make it, as they brought two very lovable character to the big screen and failed to disappoint. The story was a little cheesy and was like a Frankenstein knock-off. But with non-stop gags these things do go unnoticed and will surely make this film a big hit. If you don't laugh you may as well be a robot. What I did like about this film was that there was plenty of cute characters which included Gromit. A lot of the new characters aren't that funny and looking at Wallace's love interest it's a good thing this wasn't live action. If anything this showed that the old fashioned animation seen in the original films has died. And that vegetables can really grow really big as one of the things that made me feel for Gromit was seeing him prepare for a vegetable show that the film was centred around. A warning though there's some scenes that younger children have find to scary. And if anything it was so funny I left in tears! SEE IT OR ELSE TO SUM IT UP!!! 20/10",1.0
1175,"original and very enjoyable; post apocalyptic world. food is hard to find. the more food you have basically the wealthier you are. in France. people underground called the Trologs that are like rebels to people on the surface. thats the basis for this movie. a butcher owns a delicatessen underneath multiple levels of tenants.its the only building standing on the block. the tenants are very diverse in personalities, entertaining and weird. for eg a man that has ankle high water in his room and very wet for frogs and snails to breed for his food. a woman who tries very inventive ways to commit suicide because she hears voices in her head. a man that puts cans on his deaf mother-in-law to know where she is. i have never seen a bunch of people so crazy. oh and some kids that do some creative stuff. these characters don't do much to the story but add a lot of entertainment. the butcher has quite a strange business. he puts ads out for a free room and waits to see who will follow up on the ad to live in the room. they stay around for however so long, doing labour jobs around. then at night he kills them, chops them up, and gives them to the tenants of the building for their meat intake. Louison comes along because of the ad in the paper for the room not knowing whats going on. he used to be a clown in the circus. a romance between him and the butcher's daughter forms which lightens the movie. the movie is very original, whacked and very entertaining and quite funny as well. a gem of a movie in the 90s.",0.0
4326,"These events bad enough without revisionism...; I am from Mississippi. I lived through these times. Secretly, I did things to help in the voter-registration of Black folks; things you could get killed for, in those days. I know whereof I speak. Therefore, let me say this: the events this film seeks to depict were bad enough without any inventions. But invent they did. Every local Black person in this movie is noble and a great singer. Their buildings, however, would lead you to believe they couldn't put tin on a roof straight. Why try to improve on facts? Every White person depicted in this film is an idiot. Out-houses in the sixties? KKK ruling the roost in an entire town? Where are the rich, educated, ""landed gentry"" who were behind all this violence, encouraging the rednecks with nods and winks? Not in this movie. But I know they exist, because I know some of them...a few who are still living. Mostly it is their children I know, who still feel the same way about Blacks, and still do the same encouraging of White trash. This film does not show how things really were. It seeks to make things look even worse, to people who don't know any better. It is a terrible story, with moments of good acting from many of the stars. It is the script and the direction that are awful. What you see in this movie is not true. The truth is far worse.",0.0

8838,"The individual performances were better than the whole film; I watched this film because Martin Scorcese directed it, but did not like it much - until later that same day, and the next day and day after that I found myself thinking of the individual performances. Alice, who couldn't live without a man, even if he was a wife beater, and who wanted to be a singer but could not sing. Salty tongued Flo, who could give back as good as she got. Weepy Vera, the bored young son, and others. There was not a wrong note in the entire cast. Best of all by far was the superb Harvey Keitel playing a type that Joe Pesci has made his signature. These characters were drawn from real life. We have all seen them. Had it not been for the wonderful casting, the film would have been a total waste of time, as the story was a women's magazine myth. Just as Jill Clayburg in 'an Unmarried Woman' went out on her own and met the kind understanding 'new age' Alan Bates, Alice met the kind understanding 'new age' Kris Kristopherson. Sorry, real life ends before that part. Real life is Alice endlessly pounding the pavements in tight new shoes trying to find a job, any job and trying to get enough money to get out of living in a motel.",0.0
38038,"Enjoyable; Wallace & Gromit's full-length feature film (the Curse of the Were-Rabbit), is an enjoyable tale for the whole family. Children will continue to be amazed at the action and overall silliness of the film while adults will enjoy some of the higher level of jokes and the innocence. The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is a little better than average, but Chicken Run and the Wallace and Gromit shorts were more enjoyable. Still, this is a good movie and it is one that should be seen if you're planning on going to the cinema (or, if it has been released on video when you read this, renting it). The reason why I preferred the other Aardman productions was down to quality of story. Maybe I expected too much because this film has been in production for so long. I cannot fault the overall technique or animation; I think this is done very well, and it is good to see that they're making films like this rather than computer animation. It's much better because they do not over-do it and it doesn't look computer-animated. Well done; they deserve an Oscar for animation.",1.0
8838,"Maybe too realistic; Ellen Burstyn, no doubt, gives a fine performance as a suddenly-widowed woman who packs up her son and trekks cross-country to California to fulfill her dream of being a singer. What very well may be the film's undoing is Scorcese's almost documentary-like style, which documents events in an ridgidly mundane way--most of the shots in the recent movie SLING BLADE reminded me of this movie's style:  static medium shots of entire rooms, capturing people wandering in and out of the shot, like a tripod mounted camcorder allowed to run unattended for hours. The whole film isn't like this, of course, but there's enough of it to let the viewer know how banal and unrewarding Alice's cross-country travels and her various stays in various towns are. My big question is: how did they make a sitcom out of this decidedly unfunny movie?",0.0
19,"A worthy sequel.; (spoilers) Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls is unmistakably a childish movie, but so is the first Ace Ventura, so what did you expect? The opening sequence involving a raccoon suspended from a wire high up in the mountains (in an amusing parody of Cliffhanger) is a little too cheesy even by Ventura standards at some points, but the movie as a whole is a very satisfying comedy. Ace commits himself to an Ashram after losing the raccoon, unable to bear the emotional turmoil of allowing the poor animal to fall to its death. When Fulton Greenwall shows up to ask for Ace's help in retrieving a sacred bat so that war between two African tribes can be prevented, Ace at first refuses the task, citing how sorely needed he is here at the Ashram. The monks' wild party after he agrees to take the case was a little too childish, but it was a hilarious scene when Ace rolls the slinky down the stairs of the Ashram (`Of course! Let's do all the things that YOU wanna doÂ…'), and it was even funnier when Greenwall was trying to explain the situation to Ace on the plane (`I'm sorry, what were you saying?'). There are a lot of goofball antics that sink slightly below the level of Ace Ventura comedy, such as the dusting for fingerprints scene and Ace's `meditation' scene, but there is no shortage of laughs in the film. The hilarious scene at Ronald Kamp's party is also done in a slightly different version here, as Greenwall takes Ace to see Vincent Cadby at the consulate in Africa (`Funny, it didn't seem that painful when you were doing it to the horseÂ…'). Some of the jokes are recycled, such as Ace's breathless analysis of Cadby, but even these recycled jokes are not entirely without effect. In the movie's defense, at least the jokes weren't copied to the extent that they were copied in the sequel to Austin Powers, which was far inferior to the original. Jim Carrey delivered a style of acting in the Ace Ventura films that is fairly unique to them - he never really acted this crazy in any of his later films, probably because he became so much more well-known and this kind of acting was just too silly for the quality of an actor that he later proved himself to be. There was some of what could be called over-acting in Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, but the comedy is never compromised because of this. The Ace Ventura's are not the most classy comedies ever made, and they require the presence of at least some of your inner child in order to fully enjoy, but their comedic appeal is much higher than is common in movies like this. Watch them with an open mind, and you're sure to enjoy them.",0.0

The visuals kept my interest and I think it progressed very well from start to finish. It's not a brilliant film, but it was enjoyable to me. The visuals of this movie were stunning at times, but sub-par at other times (if you consider any of Pixar's movies to be the standard). Let's remember though that the budget for ""9"" was $40m, whereas the budget for ""The Incredibles"" and ""Up"" was $92m and $175m respectively.",0.0

71057,"Completely wasted opportunity; 9 is a wasted opportunity, which is the kind of movie that I like the least. It's one that looks great on paper and in stills, but falls short in execution. 9 could and SHOULD have been so much better than it was, but the length of the movie, above all else ruins it. They needed DESPERATELY to take more time with certain areas of the plot, to really let some things sink in so that when they come up later they have some kind of emotional resonance, but unfortunately, the plot is rushed and the movie plays out by simply switching back and forth between about one minute of exposition and ten of action for the entire 78 minutes of the movie. A few examples would be towards the beginning. When 9 first wakes up, and he's voiceless, they REALLY could have taken it slow and just let him explore the world a little bit, really giving you a feel for the environment, and REALLY showing you this post-apocalyptic setting. Look at 28 Days Later. The opening scene goes on for a very long time, just having Jim wander around a completely empty London, and in my humble opinion, that is easily the best scene in the movie. It really hits hard that the world is essentially over, it really makes an impact. Also, when 9 spends time with 1, they could have had him stay there a bit longer before IMMEDIATELY running off to go save 2. When 7 shows up and they're all surprised, because she was supposedly dead, I understood it, but didn't care. They had just mentioned her about 5 minutes prior to that, and didn't elaborate on it at all, so there was no time for it to sink in, and it had no emotional resonance when it happened. I could go on and on, but you get the point. The pacing was terrible. Also, the plot. There was little to none of it. The script needed work. A lot of work. Transformers had more of a plot, and that was a Michael Bay movie. Next, the visuals. The overall atmosphere and tone of the movie is its' one saving grace. I loved the post-apocalyptic setting, and the combination of the really cartoony sack-doll characters with the grim and bleak world made for an interesting contrast that I felt worked very well. Unfortunately, this movie was made for a budget much smaller than that of other CGI movies, and it showed. The animation and quality of the visuals was simply not up to par with the stuff that Pixar and Dreamworks are doing. While it's not bad enough to be that distracting, it's something that I and I'm sure a lot of other people noticed. My other main complaint is the character design. Not the villains and robots, mind you, but the sack-doll characters. They simply looked too similar. 9 looked like 1 who looked like 2 who looked like 7. They needed to break up the silhouettes and give them different body shapes, especially since they were pretty much all made out of burlap, making for no changes in color. 8 was easily my favorite design of the sack-dolls, because you could tell him apart the easiest. He was the only one who REALLY looked different, as he was taller, and more ""muscular."" They could have made some of them skinnier and taller, shorter and fatter, etc. This complaint is a bit nit picky, sure, but it stands nonetheless. The robots I have no real complaints about (except for one). They were all solid, if somewhat uninspired designs, though the one with the baby face that looked like a centipede was excellent. I absolutely loved that design. The main machine, though, was just too unoriginal. The single red ""eye"" is something I've seen a million and a half times since 2001. Yes, Hal was a great villain, I'm glad we all agree on that, but not every evil AI needs to look like that. At the end of the day, though, every visual problem I could have over looked if the script were better.",0.0
3751,"Absolute, Complete, Total, perfection...; From the creator of 'Wallace and Gromit' comes Chicken Run, a claymation movie about chickens trying to literaly fly the coop!  Ginger is a chicken who keeps getting caught, trying to escape from a chicken farm where the chickens get the axe if they stop laying eggs.  After several failed escapes, Ginger spots a rooster flying overhead, and it lands in their coop. His name is Rocky, a real 'Rhode Island red' as he puts it.  The site of Rocky in England has all the other chickens excited, they never have had anyone from America before in their coop.  But Ginger sees Rocky as the chickens ticket to freedom.  Ginger thinks they can escape by getting Rocky to teach everyone to fly (of course he can't, he's just an awol rooster escaping from the circus who is routinely shot out of a cannon).  But time is short, and the farmers wife has plans for a new machine where you insert chickens in one end, and out the other end comes out instant chicken pies!! This movie is hilarious, touching and absolutely perfect.  The film contains, Mac a scottish inventor, 2 vicious guard dogs, a clueless chicken named Bab, 2 shady mice (one sneaky the other dumb) who steal stuff and provide all the tools for the escape attempts from the farmers house, and Fowler an old English rooster who dis-trusts the 'American' as a Yank who knows nothing about discipline.  Fowler is probably the best character and my favourite in the film who waxes poeticaly about his days in the RAF, and is literaly the English version of Sam the Eagle on the Muppet Show. 'Always late to the war you Americans' he keeps saying.  This movie is also filled with lots of British and American bashing which is very funny, and it contains lots of parodies of other films such as 'Stalag 17', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', and 'Star Trek'. A perfect film for kids, and adults will love it.  Also the animation is INCREDIBLE.  It seems like this claymation movie could have taken 5+ years just to make!!.

4326,"Forgotten classic from the 1980s; This film is a fictional re telling of the FBI investigation into the disappearance of three civil rights workers during the 1964 voter registration drive in Mississippi. Directed by British director Alan Parker(Birdy,Angel Heart) it focuses on two contrasting FBI agents. One is Alan Ward(Willem Dafoe), you and idealistic, and the other Rupert Anderson(Gene Hackman) is older and shrewder. Both men want to solve the case,but their different styles mean that they keep butting heads. Anderson, a Southerner,understands the people.He may not be a racist himself, but he knows what motivates people. The story he tells Ward about an incident in his childhood is very telling. He is fully aware about what is right and wrong. Ward on the other hand, is confused by the actions of Southerners.He actually says""What is wrong with these people?"" which highlights his anger and frustration.In many ways, this is Hackman's film. He fully deserved his Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Parker does not skimp on the violence, he shows you just how cruel the Ku Klax Klan can be in their use of terror. Churches are burnt down and people are beaten. Unlike the recent film Selma, the violence is not watered down. We also have a sub plot of Anderson getting close to one of the local women by played by future Oscar winner Frances McDormand. Her husband Brad Dourif's Deputy Pell may actually be part of the Ku Klux Klan. Look out for small parts from Tobin Bell, Frankie Faison,Michael Rooker and Park Overall. If I have one complaint about this film, it is that it does not have a proper black character. Most of the black actors portray victims of violence or passive bystanders.

38038,"Oooh I do like a bit of Wallace and GromitÂ…; Wallace and Gromit. The pair has been adored by the British nation since they first arrived on our TV screens in the early 90s. Wallace, the cheese-loving eccentric inventor and his genius canine companion who never says a word are the 'pair that started it all' for director Nick Park, director of Chicken Run and three times Oscar-winner. This movie is the first ever full-length Wallace and Gromit film, and it certainly will not disappoint fans of the duo. The movie expands on the local neighbourhood of West Wallaby Street and beyond, introducing new characters never before seen, notably PC Mackintosh voiced by the British comic legend Peter Kay, and reverend Clement Hedges voiced by Are You Being Served's Nicholas Smith. However, the two star names and star performances are Helena Bonham Carter as the vegetable-mad aristocrat and new love interest for Wallace, Lady Tottington, and the brilliantly versatile Ralph Fiennes as the baddie, the 'no-nonsense' huntsman Victor Quartermaine. The key to all Aardman films and their distinctly British humour is to always watch what is happening in the background Â– this film is no exception. The film gets funnier every time you watch it as you always spot new meanings in what the characters are doing, what they're standing in front of, or how they're positioned. Aardman fully deserve another Oscar with this hilarious spoof-filled outing. Better than Chicken Run, they only continue to improve. Enjoyable for all ages.",1.0
1080,"Still one of the funniest films of all time.; It's impossible for me to be objective about this film.  I know every scene and line by heart.  Not because I'm one of those ghastly Python nerds, whose anal obsessiveness sucks the whole spirit out of everything they did, and actually misses the joke, which is on them; they are the perfect subjects for a Python lampoon.  No.  I only know LIFE OF BRIAN so intimately because I've seen it so often, it's still one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen, and persists in being hilarious despite familiarity, which, as in so much Python did, is the reverse of what comedy is 'supposed' to be made of (i.e. surprise). Also, nostalgia value.  MONTY PYTHON were my first heroes, before I even reached double figures.  I gobbled up every programme, film and record in a space of a couple of short years, so they are bound up with a period of my life when I was very happy and hopeful, so I go all misty-eyed when I see it.  Bizarrely, we were first encouraged to watch BRIAN by our Latin teacher, who felt it was very insightful about Roman society. But no-one watches PYTHON anymore, except that dorkish clique.  My brother, only a couple of years my junior, is as mystified now by my reaction to it as my parents were then.  But surely BRIAN is a comic masterpiece in itself, accessible to anyone who found the very male, elitist, academic bias of the programme somewhat alienating? How can I implore you to watch this?  It's got a straight narrative, with some of the greatest set-pieces and dialogue of any film ever.  It's not a great FILM comedy - Terry Jones is no Gilliam - but the style suits the humour perfectly, allowing it to breathe, and sometimes pulling off an extraordinarily evocative shot, such as when Brian and his mother are walking from Jesus' sermon, and squabbling about petty things like big noses, and the camera pulls back to a vast Judean wasteland, with a massive Roman statue being wheeled, and a set of crucifixes being planted: a marvellous encapsulation of a period in history. This is the film's true triumph - it's a magnificent deconstruction of historical distortion.  By paralleling the life of Christ with that of an ordinary little man, Python reclaim history from symbol and myth.  It brings the body back into history.  Its resolute rejection of divinity leads to a bleak, ironic conclusion (listen to 'Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life' carefully, and in context: it's NOT comforting) - the story of Jesus without redemption is ghastly. The intelligence behind the juvenile gags is astonishing - the film is a learned commentary on power, totalitarianism, repression, language, gender, the writing of history, the politics of subversion, the complicity of the repressed.  Myth is thrown to the wind - the film succeeds where Reg and his revolutionaries fail, by revealing a whole series of repressive apparatum (sic?).  No-one is spared - the film is unashamedly destructive, but the film's satire is not arid or narrow; there are many rich parallels with our own time, as the extraordinary reaction from the religious on the film's release showed. But BRIAN is not just an attack on religion, but on all who would seek to write selective histories for their own interests, suppressing others' voices.  The silliest jokes are also the most profound - in one scene, the kidnappers enter Pilate's palace through a tiled floor.  They emerge through a modesty-concealing leaf painted on this floor.  This is snickering schoolboy humour, and very very funny, but is also a comment on the phallocentricity of imperialism.  Jokes like these are why BRIAN will always remain vital - it turns you into a ludicrous, ill-informed amateur historian. The acting is an astonishing feat of multiple performances, but Graham Chapman, always my favorite Python, holds the chaos together, ironically as the Kafkaesque hero who races towards the abyss, an anti-Jesus to love and identify with.  If I've made the film sound like hard work, than I'm an idiot.  The seriousness is only there if you want it.  Like Alice in Wonderland, or Buster Keaton, PYTHON seem to be full of metaphors that encapsulate the pains of life, but are also damnably entertaining.  It's strange that men as supposedly 'surreal' and 'out there' as the Pythons should speak such good sense.  Only BRINGING UP BABY, THE PALM BEACH STORY, and MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, are funnier than this.  Treasure it.",0.0
5540,"Clash of the Titans; Perseus(Harry Hamlin), the son of Zeus(the great Laurence Olivier), a mortal who is heir to the kingdom of Argos, must vanquish the monstrous sea monster, Kraken, in order to save a princess, Andromeda(the impossibly beautiful Judi Bowker)doomed by their goddess Thetis(Maggie Smith)for the decapitated hand of her accursed son, Colibos(Neil McCarthy). Colibos was once a man destined to marry Andromeda, a curse placed on him which removed his handsomeness, rendering him hoof-heeled monstrosity with a tail, forehead horns, and deformed facial features. Thetis wishes to put Perseus in harm's way and Zeus commands that his goddess wives provide his son with proper equipment necessary to defend himself against those that would threaten his life and well being. While I do consider this a step down from other films featuring Harryhausen's superb stop motion animated monsters, the master's magnificence still shines bright with such creatures as the winged stallion Pegasus, Colibos from a distance(..close-ups of McCarthy only reveal him in make-up from the neck up), a giant vulture which brings a caged Andromeda to Colibos' hidden lair in a marsh swampland, Medusa(whose head was needed to defeat the Kraken, considered invulnerable)with the hair of snakes along with her rattling tail(..her look turning any living creature into stone and blood considered poisonous and deadly), the golden owl(..who guides Perseus to the shrine of 3 blind, grotesque Stygian witches who eat humans, use a glowing crystal as their eye, and know a possible secret in defeating Kraken), large scorpions born from the blood of Medusa's head, and, of course, the Kraken. Such places Perseus finds himself include the amphitheater in Joppa where he encounters and befriends the loyal and wise Ammon(the delightful Burgess Meredith), accompanying him on several sojourns, the ""Lair of the Lord of the Marsh"" where he discovers Colibos' hideaway(..also learning of his hypnotic curse over Andromeda regarding a riddle that sends possible suitors to be burned alive if they fail to answer it correctly), Medusa's darkened lair found in the ruins of a forgotten city, and across the River Styx after paying the ferryman a coin(the ferryman a skeleton underneath a cloak who boats them across to an island to encounter the dreaded Medusa). I think the Medusa sequence was simply difficult to top, which may be why(to me anyway)the final showdown between Perseus and Kraken isn't quite as impressive, although the monster is still quite a sight to behold. I think the target audience for this kind of adventure fantasy, which is essentially a series of perilous journeys supplying Perseus with hurdles to overcome, with more than a little assistance from the gods(the sword which protects him many times, in particular against Medusa, the helmet of invisibility, and the sword that can even slice apart marble), will please the fans of Harryhausen and of the sword and sorcery genre. Not quite as satisfying as ""Jason and the Argonauts"" or ""The Golden Voyage of Sinbad"", but I think it'll have more than enough to entertain the appropriate crowd it is made for. Olivier seems to be enjoying himself as the all powerful Zeus while the mortals, for the exception of Meredith, seem cast more for their looks.",0.0

50005,"Shakespeare with ninjas; Shakespearian and flawed, sublime and ridiculous, moving and irritating, talky and with an impossibly high body count, King Lear and Hamlet meet Hero and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, the Curse of the Golden Flower by Zhang Yimou is nearly impossible to describe. There is something great about it, but also something unconvincing. The result, while interesting, is uneven to say the least. Ancient China: the Emperor (Chow Yun-Fat) is slowly poisoning his wife (Gong Li), who has a relationship with her stepson, prince Wan (Ye Liu), heir to the throne. The other two sons are noble Jai (Jay Chou) and young Yu (Junjie Qin). Jai decides to help his mother overthrow the Emperor, while Wan takes his father's side. Chan (pretty Man Li), daughter of the Emperor's doctor (Dahong Ni) and a mysterious woman (Jin Chen) are also involved. There are moments of sheer beauty in the Curse of the Golden Flower, but also scenes looking phoney and contrived. Some set-pieces are great - ninjas assaulting a house in a misty valley, golden and silver armours clashing - but other bits look uncomfortably computer-generated. Hero was on another level. Every frame is saturated with deep colours, creating an oppressive atmosphere inside the maze-like palace, with the always-repeating ritual of the ""cure"" with which the Emperor poisons his wife. The movie quickly captured my interest. Then it lost momentum with some awkward moments. Fortunately, it recovered with the bitter last act. Acting is strong. Gorgeous, elegant Gong Li plays the Empress, probably the character with more screen time. She gives a powerful performance as a woman driven by strong feelings: hate towards her husband, maternal love for her son Jai, forbidden passion for her stepson, jealousy towards young Chan. Also excellent is always charismatic Chow Yun-Fat as the Emperor, a cruel tyrant who is genuinely fond of his sons. Jay Chou and Ye Liu are fine as the two princes faced with moral dilemmas. Hero was one of the best-looking movies ever made, but I found it morally reprehensible. Here the message is more ambiguous, with Yimou trying to show the brutality and solitude of power in this Shakespearian tragedy set in Ancient China. The result falls somewhere between ""brilliant but flawed"" and ""interesting failure"", worth watching for the remarkable performances. 6/10",0.0

There is a beauty in simplicity, and that's what I enjoy about the older movies so much.

6101,"A Journey of Discovery and Self-Discovery; Missing marks a turn in Costa-Gavras' career. It was not only his first English-speaking movie (arguably the only great one he made); but he also changed his narrative style to conform to Hollywood's traditional structure. Up until Missing, Costa-Gavras had made impersonal movies about ensemble casts, shot in semi-documentary style. Missing saw him focus the story on a protagonist, the way Hollywood does. This is not a criticism, since I rate Missing as highly as Z. And to be honest, up until this movie, he had never had such a great actor to work with as Jack Lemmon. Jack Lemmon is very much the soul of this political thriller about a good middle-aged American businessman who travels to Chile after Pinochet has taken over to find his missing son, a left-wing journalist who knew more than he should about the involvement of the United States in the coup. Like a typical Costa-Gavras movie, this is an indictment of totalitarianism and injustice and an attempt to expose the role the so-called democratic United States had in overthrowing a democracy and implementing a dictatorship that arrested, tortured and killed thousands, in the name of 'American interests'. But digging deeper it's about Ed Horman and his daughter-in-law Beth (a wonderful performance by Sissy Spacek) trying to find Charles Horman (John Shea), in a journey of self-discovery as the patriotic Ed comes to realise the country he believes in is not only lying to him but is actively trying to prevent him from finding the truth. Costa-Gavras' movies always illicit a feeling of helplessness from me. I always despair at watching his characters walking through endless red tape, bogus laws, cover-ups, conspiracies, and arriving nowhere while injustice lives on. We know it shouldn't be like that, and yet that's what always happens in cases when individuals fight against governments. Ed Horman's struggle to find his son is worthy of admiration and yet is pointless, and the viewer can't help sympathise with Ed's failure to make sense of what happened. On an even more intimate level, Missing is also a movie about a family coming together, as Ed begins to understand who his estranged son really was and comes to terms with the way of life he led, and is brought closer to Charles' wife, Beth, who is just as untiring in her pursuit of the truth. Playing to a wonderful score by Vangelis, who composed a very emotional main theme, and with great cinematography from Ricardo Aronovich and editing from FranÃ§oise Bonnot, Missing is also a fast-paced account of life during the Chilean dictatorship, a time when gun shots and explosions were omnipresent and were very much part of daily life. The sound was amazing in this movie, as conversations were constantly punctuated by the sounds of war happening just on a nearby street, giving the movie the impression of really being in the middle of a civil war. Arguably one of Costa-Gavras' best movies, it was also his last great one. The '80s and '90s were just awful for him, and only in the new millennium has he returned to his former glory with movies like Amen and Le Couperet. If this is the last movie he'll be remembered for, at least he'll be remembered for all the great reasons: as a director who could bring humanity to political stories and who was unique in the condemnation of injustice.",0.0

His father Ed(played by Jack Lemmon) is a conservative businessman who arrives in Chile to find him, though despite assurances from the American consulate that they will look into the matter, isn't convinced, and with Beth's help, discovers the awful truth about his son's fate and the complicity of his own government in the matter...

1175,"Surrealistic but Great; I had been looking forward to watching this film since they put a more popular Jeunet's masterpiece on TV, AmÃ©lie, and my uncle said it reminded him a lot of a film he had seen a few years ago, called Delicatessen. One thing that attracted my attention was the fact that, in spite of being set in a hypothetical future, the building outside and inside looks like they were in the 50s, with the old TVs and furniture and wallpaper. And also the tenants dressed as if they were more or less from that age. The film is obscure and crude, nevertheless the main characters (the ex-clown and the butcher's daughter) provide the human warmth that balances the film. Without them I can say it'd seem that the world that Jeunet has created for this film is just inhabited by mere animals. Finally I'd like to point out a movie that came to my mind as I was watching this one, Alex de la Iglesia's 'La Comunidad', it's Spanish and it was made a few years after Delicatessen so I may think the director picked some ideas from this Jeunet's movie. I recommend everyone sees this film, is just as surrealistic and harsh and I'll just say that the main difference between both is that the tenants at 'La Comunidad' are greedy instead of cannibals.",0.0

The dialogue is minimal, to say the least. The story is touching, and if you pay attention, you will easily follow it as it takes you from A to B to C.

6493,"More of the same...and it works!; ***Spoilers*** The romantic comedy mastermind Rob Reiner (The Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally) delivers more of the same in Alex and Emma. Over the years, Reiner has set certain trends with his films. In Princess Bride, the audience is given wit, charm, action and adventure, drama, and love all rolled up into one nice little package. In When Harry Met Sally, the audience sees Billy Crystal at his best, pure genious comedy  before their eyes courtesy of Mr. Riener. The most recent, Alex and Emma follows the trends of its predecessors in delivering a fun romantic comedy with it's moments of comedy, charm, and heart warming kisses. It's not thought provoking and it doesn't push the audience to be drained emotionally. The story carries itself as any romantic comedy does; they meet, fall in love, fight, and the ending gives you butterflies in your stomach. However it is the original fashion in with Alex and Emma plays out, that makes this film entertaining. Alex Sheldon (Luke Wilson) and Emma Dinsmore (Kate Hudson) meet when Alex calls her in to be his stenographer. He is a writer that has 30 days to complete a novel and make a 100,000 dollar pay off to Cuban thugs or else he will be killed. The story takes us into the mind of Alex as the audience watches not only the novel he is writing but the process in which he is writing it. The film is good on a number of levels, and in all honesty Luke Wilson is not one of them. His performance lacked creativity and focus. Throughout the whole film he struggled to find solid ground between the many different personality traits of his character, and as a result of it, most of his work seemed overdone. If it wasn't for the lovely Hudson carrying him along, this film would have been an absolute failure. As is, Hudson is wonderfully cute, charming, and because of that, she becomes the backbone of the film. She portrays her character flawlessly from the beginning, causing the audience to care for her more than anyone else on the screen. As the closing credits roll, even the biggest skeptic of romantic comedies and Reiner will find himself with a smile on his face. The fact that Reiner takes a mediocre script and executes it in a beautiful entertaining fashion suggests that we ought to give this film more respect than it's getting. Every film serves a purpose, and it would seem that this film's purpose is to provide the audience with laughs, tears, and in the end, a warm fuzzy feeling in their stomach. If that's the case, then hats off to Reiner and Co. for a job well done.",0.0

4388,"Help Me Again Because I have fallen again and I can't get up!; Starring: Anna Faris, Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Chris Elliot, Tim Curry, Kathleen Robertson, Chris Masterson, Tori Spelling, David Cross and James DeBello Rated R for Strong Sexual and Gross Humor, Graphic Language and Some Drug Content Genre: Horror/Comedy/Mystery Star Rating: **** out of 5 This is the second installment of the Scary Movie series with more spoofs and crazy stuff! As we left off from the first Scary Movie the survivors Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), Ray Wilkins (Shawn Wayans), and Shorty (Marlon Wayans) and Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), are at college, trying to forget the incidents that occurred last Halloween. Cindy is falling for Buddy (Christopher Kennedy Masterson), who loves to give wedgies, and Ray is still confused about his sexuality. Professor Oldman (Tim Curry) and his paralyzed assistant, Dwight (David Cross), have decided to do a research study at Hell House, the house where the bad exorcism took place, and disguise it as a sleep disorder study. Chaos starts as soon as Cindy arrives and meets the creepy caretaker (Chris Elliot) with the funny hand. But the house has some deep dark secrets that the group has to solve, even if they are scary or disgusting. So this movie spoofs ""Charlie's Angels"", ""House on Haunted Hill"", ""13 Ghosts"", ""Paulie"", ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" and ""The Poltergeist"". One of my favorite parts in the movie is where Cindy is driving in her car and listening to Vitamin C's song ""Graduation"" and Cindy is singing along to the song very badly so Vitamin C on the radio tells her to shut up and let her sing! Another funny part I liked was when Anna, Theo and Brenda were going to fight Hanson the guy with the funny looking hand, the three girls where running down the stairs while changing into their Charlie's Angels costumes and then when they come down you at first see them with their underwear and then they run back to change into their costumes. Another part I liked was the part where the group was with Dwight and he was handing out their items to defeat the ghosts and Brenda asks if there where any communication systems like walkie-talkies but instead all he had was just a line of string with two dixie cups on both sides! Another funny part was Shorty was teaching Cindy how to be all ghetto. I like this as well as the first one! Another thing I liked about this movie is that Tim Curry is in this movie and I think Tim Curry is hilarious and a good actor. BOTTOM LINE: FUNNY AS WELL AS THE FIRST AND I'M STILL LAUGHING!",0.0

4326,"Great movie; Burning Mississippi is a very motivational and inspiring movie about the civil rights movement in the south. This movie displays a very negative image of the Ku Klux Clan (KKK) and it shows the brutality of their actions in the 1950's and 60's. In the beginning the movie demonstrated how the mindset was in the state of Mississippi. The movie introduces this mindset through FBI agent Anderson. Anderson has no respect for the black people in the south and believes that the state has just concerns in the segregation of Negroes. Anderson's boss Allen Ward disagrees with his philosophy and he sees everyone equal. The two Agents are sent to Mississippi to uncover what happened to three boys earlier in the month, two of the boys where white and one was black, which made the case very interesting. Agent Anderson saw the case as a simple ""missing persons"" case where as Allen Ward sees it as a full-investigation and a big case. At first in the movie the Depute and the County Sheriff see the two FBI agents as idiots and showed them no respect.

Wallace and Gromit are on a mission to save their town and vegetables from a monstrous vegetable-loving were-rabbit. The voice work is pretty good.

Unfortunately, once you get past the technical brilliance there is little of memorable value. Character development is truncated and sacrificed on the altar of fast-paced action sequences. When will directors realize that audiences need to care about characters before a story becomes involving? We have the stereotypical old stick-in-the-mud, the kindly but impotent victim, the sphinx-like twins, the helpless but well-intentioned bumbler, the manic artiste, the daring warrior, the muscle-bound henchman, and the prophesied messiah whom no one understands or wants to follow until the last minute. All of them seem like cardboard standees. And I'm not sure what the message of the film is supposed to be: Friendship? We need to put our soul in our technology? Better living through alchemy? Scientists need to turn to antiquated mysticism before they invent anymore machines? Our souls have 9 parts? How does one put one's soul into a technology, anyway? Is Steve Jobs our example?

66097,"So why are beetroots better than flowers? Great potential and lots of room for improvement.; As a great admirer of doll animation I was fascinated and impressed by the amount of work the creators of the movie has put into it. A close look at the clothes, interiors and the enchanted flowers was like appreciating a piece of art. It applied to everything but the characters, which seemed to be way too sharp-edged, their proportions were too disturbed and often the general impression too grotesque as compared to classic animation. After reading a brief synopsis, no to mention the book, you already know the whole story. Real life and real people seem so dull and cold and the other world seems so luring, until it becomes a real nightmare. Having fought the evil witch and destroyed the illusion of the other world Coraline learns to appreciate her real family and neighbors. However, I don't see how the change in the characters did take place. Coraline shows more affection towards her parents simply because she missed them and they at least don't want to kill her or sew buttons on her face. The parents seem more cheerful and less distant than at the beginning of the movie, but not because of the adventure. They don't remember anything that happened in the other world, they simply feel relaxed and optimistic because they have completed their job that had kept them busy. Could that be a permanent change? Was the witch gone forever after the spider-needle-hand was tossed into the well? The story doesn't justify how the real world transformed from really unfriendly (ice-cold parents, disturbed neighbors) to fairly normal. It is disappointing because I expected a real allegory of repairing family relations and mirroring of the real world in the other world not only by the looks but by the course of events (somewhat like in ""The Pan's Labyrinth""). Another big doubt about the movie is the age of a target audience. It is way too creepy for little children, but not challenging enough to grasp teenagers' and adults' attention. A real beetroot is better for you than an illusion of a flower, yet I'm not sure if it was exactly what this symbol stood for. Maybe it wasn't symbolic at all. The movie is without doubt memorable, but I'd rather have a little more beetroot than flower in it i.e. more story over the picture.",0.0
6773,"Unusual and delightful; Rarely am I riveted by animated cinema that isn't good Japanese Anime, but 'The Triplets of Belleville' had my eyes glued to the screen from the beginning. The story is quite simple: A grandmother tries to make her young grandson (who is living with her) happy, and discovers his fascination for bicycles, so she buys him one. Cut to years later, and he is now a contender for the Tour de France, with his grandmother still doting on him, now acting as his trainer. During the race itself he and other riders are kidnapped and taken to Belleville, so the grandmother and their enormously fat dog go looking for him. Without money or shelter, the two are discovered by three old women, former famous vaudevillians Â– The Triplets of Belleville. They invite her and the dog in to stay and help her attempt to rescue her grandson. 'The Triplets of Belleville' is wonderfully unusual in many ways. Firstly, the character design by director Sylvain Chomet is abstract and garish. Most characters are extremely ugly, and almost every citizen of Belleville other than the primaries are grotesquely obese. (Even the Statue of Liberty in Belleville's harbor is ridiculously fat) The goons who kidnap the grandson are hilarious in their design Â– they have tall, completely square shoulders and at times morph together. The cyclists have half inch waists, agonized faces and enormous leg muscles. Also, there is almost no dialogue during the 81 minute film. There are a couple of songs, (the music in 'Belleville' is great) but other than some incidental sounds, there is maybe a couple of lines of actual dialogue. This serves as definitive proof that the film was brilliantly told through the action and animation. To be sure, 'The Triplets of Belleville' is not for everyone. It is probably the antithesis of Disney or Pixar in its abstractness, intelligence and design. Not to say that the others are not intelligent, most aren't, but films like 'Finding Nemo' rely on pop culture to convey their wit, whereas 'The Triplets of Belleville' is brilliantly compelling with a handful of words. A strong 8/10. --Shelly",0.027777777777777776

71057,"9 captures our souls; 9 is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I congratulate Shane Acker, Tim Burton and all of the people who made this film for doing a really good job. It proves that an animation does not have to be just for children. The apocalyptic world is beautifully rendered, as are the stitchpunk characters and the robotic monsters. The back story is also well thought out, and the film is a delight (if a bit scary) to watch. Some people may find it a bit confusing, but that's because they don't pay attention. If you listen to what is going on, you should clearly understand what is happening. True, 72 minutes may seem a bit short for some, but I think that this amount of time is plenty. Also, the cast and characters in this film are part of the high quality this film has. Many stars such as Elijah Wood, Christopher Plummer, Jennifer Connelly and John C. Reilly feature in this film, and their presence adds to the film's greatness. I would highly recommend 9 for anyone to watch, and I think if you enjoyed Tim Burton's other works and Coraline, you will enjoy this! :)",0.0
3751,"A little plasticine can go a long way; From the team behind Wallace and Gromit comes this great kids film about Chickens that are trying to escape from their owners. While the premise is simple what is not simple is the great characters and the jokes that come thick and fast as the minds of Aardman manage to create a film that adults and children can all enjoy. The film is nearly 12 years old now but still looks great and is far better than a lot of the films that adults have to sit through with their kids these days. The comedy comes from the characters and not lots of tricks and 3D technology. Aardman in this and in all their other films make well crafted entertainment and there isn't a lot of that around these days. From parodies of other films, great jokes and characters Chicken Run will always be fondly remembered.",0.875
6773,"Goes beyond the boundaries and limitations of language; To think that I almost missed watching this wonderful movie because it has no close-captioning! But it doesn't need subtitles nor captioning to convey all the emotions of the characters, including Bruno the dog. The animators go beyond the boundaries and limitations of language, making this film truly universally understood by anyone. My absolute favorite was Bruno the dog! What a dog! His eyebrows are so expressive that you know exactly what he is feeling and wanting during the film. His dreams are in glorious canine black and white with themes that revolve around food, his master Champion, and the trains that go by on schedule - and at which Bruno loves to bark at on schedule. The grandmother is the epitome of grandmotherly-love and her huge thick glasses and one short leg do not stand in the way of her seeking to get her beloved grandson Champion back from the kidnappers.

This is a film that is both good and bad. Fans of Wallace, Gromit and Nick Park will probably enjoy it. The time and effort that goes into this kind of animation is unbelievable. Is it harder than hand-drawing? Maybe, maybe not... but everything has to be just right, which makes it seem like more of a process than the computer animation of today (2015). But the story is not that great, or at least not as memorable. Today, ""Wrong Trousers"" and ""Chicken Run"" are something of modern classics, but ""Were Rabbit"" has been more or less forgotten. A huge splash in 2005-2006, perhaps, but only decreasing in popularity since. Unfortunate, really, given the great voice talent (Helena Bonham Carter, Ralph Fiennes) involved.",1.0
6773,"Interesting; This movie was unique, odd, and interesting. It had some funny parts, and the Belleville Rendezvous song is very good and catchy. The animation was entertaining. However, it was not realistic at all, which is okay, but it, in my opinion, is lacking a little in the plot. It's so weird that its hard to understand it in full, which isolated me from the movie. There were a number of scenes where it was really difficult to understand (spoiler ahead), especially the last scene when the boy (as an old man) says, ""I know what to say to you Grandma, Its the end"" or something like that. I did not understand what he meant, and when I don't understand the end, then I really don't understand the movie. How the movie is made makes it impossible, or at least very difficult to understand.

This movie cannot be described by mere words. People always criticize Hollywood movies because of the lack in realism in them, but '9' is so realistic that everything in the movie feels like 'real'. The acting of every actor in the movie is commendable. Songs are used only when they are required. Everything about the movie was just perfect. Despite having heard lots of depressing opinions on this movie I decided to watch it & I am really happy that I did. Although, yeah, most of the points were predictable, I'd give it a better than average vote for depiction of the agony, loss of confidence & retaliation that develops due to gross mistreatment.

Little scenes like the ocean steamer being chased by a water cycle with and old lady and a fat dog did not make me laugh, as this description would imply, but I was actually chasing the big boat too, wanting to catch up and make things right.

50005,"And you thought your family get togethers were bad; However overused the expression may be, Curse of the Golden Flower is a movie that gives you the perfect excuse to shell out on a massive flat screen television. Director Zhang Yimou is already renowned for his striking cinematography and the ability to produce some of the most beautiful martial arts films you will ever see, but it still cannot prepare you for what a visual experience it is. This film is simply beautiful, every shot, every camera angle, every frame has been carefully considered and planned out to ensure that the images tell the story as much as the acting, the colour practically bursting out the screen. The story meanwhile is packed full of the intrigue, treachery, violence and tragedy that have become synonymous with Yimou and the finished film comes off like a Chinese version of Ran, only with more Ninjas and fewer Samurai. Set once again in feudal China, Yimou visits the sumptuous palaces of the ruling classes as the Emperor Ping (Chow Yun-Fat) returns home with his son Prince Jai (Jay Chou) after a prolonged absence. His intention is apparently to celebrate the upcoming Chrysanthemum festival with his wife (Gong Li) and his sons, Princes Wan (Liu Ye) and Yu (Jungie Qin). However, his intentions are altogether more sinister and in his time away, secret allegiances have been made and illicit affairs have sprung up, leading to mistrust and secrecy among the royal family. As their various plots unravel, the palace is set for a collision of loyalties that result in bitterness, violence and death. Thank God the in-laws didn't show up as well or things could have got really messy. Needless to say, Golden Flower is grandiose film making on an epic scale. Yimou was clearly going for a Shakespearean tale of folly and disaster amid the ruling classes and despite the occasional over the top breakdown, he pulls it off. The actors meanwhile succeed admirably in their roles, Gong Li, Jay Chou and the veteran Chow Yun Fat especially. These are royals after all and showing their emotions when their status prevents it is no easy task, but they all commit themselves well. Chow absolutely shines as the scheming, no-nonsense Emperor and it's easy to see why Gong Li has been such a success on the international sphere. What may be most surprising though is that for the majority of the film, there is almost no violence at all. Instead, Yimou favours tension-filled family meetings and back room negotiations. In this sense, it is more of a family drama than a 'proper' martial arts movie, but the balance is readdressed in the action-packed finale where an army of Gold clad warriors storms the palace for a vicious battle among the courtyards and corridors so intense that characters are literally buried beneath corpses. Aside from the fact that the subtitles on the DVD are infuriatingly small, there aren't many complaints I could make about this movie. As a piece of purely visual art it is breathtaking and while it might get a bit silly every now and again (the sheer number of soldiers appearing out of nowhere in the finale, the Ninjas in the attic), it's a welcome addition to any Eastern cinema collection. It's also (whisper it) not as long as you might think and tells a story that had the potential to be four hours long in less than two. It's not the greatest martial arts movie ever, but it's certainly the brightest and if you only ever watch one Zhang Yimou film, Curse of the Golden Flower is a good choice.",0.0

1175,"""The film is fantastically grim and depressing and if one was to live there you would surely be driven quite mad!""; After reading the back of the DVD case I noticed the words `futuristic comedy'. Am I the only one who didn't find it funny? Granted it has some comical parts, but I would say it was more irony than comedy. The poor crazed woman `Aurore Interligator' repeatedly trying to commit suicide but somehow always being foiled in the silliest of ways is more of a tedious act rather than comedy. The movie is about a post-apocalyptic town with no food and desperate times have lead to desperate measures being taken. The local butcher recruits Â‘new' people to the town as helpers and then murders them to sell their flesh to the townspeople. The film is fantastically grim and depressing and if one was to live there you would surely be driven quite mad! It is of course `one of those quirky, weird' films where nothing is quite right in the world. Films like that always seem to freak me out when you see how people have lead their lives and what their principals are, and compared to the lives we lead are just absurd. To round off, this film is an excellent piece of work. It's in French with English subtitles but many of the truly great films are from another country, with another perspective. It stays well away from gory killings and just leaves the mind to wonder what has gone on and the overall atmosphere generated from the movie is eerie to say the least. A brilliant movie.",0.0
6493,"one of 2003's worst; There are few filmmakers who run as hot-and-cold as Rob Reiner.  When he's cooking on all burners Â– as with `When Harry Met Sally' and `The American President' Â– he's been able to create some of the most compleat and satisfying romantic comedies of recent years.  Yet, when the muses have eluded him Â– as with `North,' `The Sum of Us' and the appalling `Alex and Emma' - Reiner has produced some truly classic stinkers, films so misguided and infamously bad as to make us wonder whether this could indeed be the same man responsible for all these different films. `Alex and Emma' steals its premise pretty much intact from `Paris When it Sizzles,' that notorious 1964 misfire that probably established a career low for both Audrey Hepburn and William Holden, two of the most likable and attractive performers of their time.  In `Alex and Emma,' Luke Wilson portrays a successful fiction writer in hock to some Cuban gamblers who are threatening to kill him if he doesn't pay them from the proceeds from his new Â– as yet unwritten Â– novel.  After the thugs burn his computer, Alex hires a stenographer, played by Kate Hudson, to help him complete the new tome in time.   The two, of course, despise each other at first, but as Alex dictates his novel to her, with Emma providing pointed criticism and helping him shape the final product, true love begins to bloom. As with the recent `Big Fish,' the story here runs along parallel tracks, as Wilson and Hudson act out scenes from the work Alex is writing - a cheap dime-store novel set in the scenic 1920's.  The book is so preposterously corny, melodramatic and clichÃ©d that we can scarce believe anyone would write such a work, let alone publish it, though we are led to believe that all sorts of people who would know better in real life stand in great awe of both the book and Alex's talents as a writer.  The scenes set in the fictional world he's created, though very pretty to look at, are excruciatingly arch, coy and cloying, poorly acted and even more poorly written.   Wilson and Hudson do little but play dress-up in these scenes, set completely adrift by a humorless script and directionless direction.  The scenes set in `real' time are scarcely more palatable, although the actors are at least able to relax a bit and let more of their likeability shine through. `Alex and Emma,' though billed as a romantic comedy, has a true tin ear when it comes to both romance and comedy.  Reiner has once again struck out in his own ballpark. ",0.0
3751,"Animation, good; music, good; film, overrated...; I know I should have loved this, but the scene where the ""crate"" was unveiled cemented it for me... this was a plasticine take on ""A Bug's Life"" by way of ""The Great Escape,"" and not a patch on either. Aardman's animation is great, of course; and like the subsequent (and also (though less) overrated) ""Shrek"" it has a terrific score by John Powell and Harry Gregson-Williams that played a big part in getting me through this film. Unfortunately, maybe it was too big a part - some Luddites object strenously to sitting through the Disney/Pixar movies because they're CGI animated instead of being done by hand (and they don't know what they're missing...), but John Lasseter and Co. devote as much time to the story and characters as they do to the animation. Here we're served up an ex-RAF rooster called Fowler who's an intentional stiff-upper-lip British stereotype - but everyone else is a stereotype as well (from the fellow chickens to the human villain Mrs. Tweedy). I should have been laughing and I should have been cheering them on as they try and try again to escape, and to be fair it does have an entertaining finale; but for the most part ""Chicken Run"" just doesn't really engage the emotions the way it should. What with this and ""A Close Shave"" (which everyone other than me seems to have found a masterpiece), it's beginning to look as if Nick Park peaked with the truly classic ""The Wrong Trousers."" Or maybe this should have been a half-hour project. I'll stick with Buzz Lightyear and ""The Red And The Blue"", thanks. For you, the review is over.

I don't know what to say about cartoon characters like these--I almost expected a couple of minutes of outtakes and blunders at the end, because there were times I almost forgot that someone had drawn them.  What they do and how they look has nothing to do with a realistic style of portrayal, yet you get the feel that in order to make this film they did a lot of research on the people they were portraying.  Each character is very human (or dog), from the tiniest smile on Champion's face, to Madame's eyes behind her glasses, to the low-decibel whine of Bruno's frustrations.  And the triplets are stunning, both in the opening and later, when they are again performing. It's so hard to know what to say--I am still sort of reeling from the experience.

1175,"Perfect for My Tastes; Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) is a butcher who runs the generically named ""Delicatessen"" housed in a bombed-out looking apartment building filled to the brim with eccentrics. Since food is scarce in the film's world, Clapet has devised a scheme to provide himself and his tenants with a regular supply of meat--he runs ads in the local paper for handymen, and after they fix a few things on the building, they become the main course. When the film begins, we see a man who tries unsuccessfully to escape. The bulk of the film is the story of Stan Luison (Dominique Pinon), who is the latest person to answer Clapet's advertisement. This film is definitely an acquired taste, so to speak. I've acquired the taste, and for me, it's a 10 out of 10. Delicatessen is set in a weird, post-apocalyptic, alternate universe that is not entirely dissimilar to the setting of Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985)--in fact, this could very easily be the same world as Brazil, just that that film is situated in its titular locale, and this would be a less fashionable section of France. Like Brazil, most of the production design--the costumes, music, television programming, etc.--suggests an historic setting, say about the 1940s, but it also seems to be set in the future, or at least an alternate present. In place of Brazil's elaborate, chaotic technology, directors Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet have created a multi-leveled Rube Goldberg construction. Goldberg was an American cartoonist and sculptor known for drawings of incredibly complex contraptions that often performed simple tasks. This recurs from small scales--the interconnected tubes in the building and the uses of the ""Australian"", to medium scalesÂ—Aurore Interligator's (Silvie Laguna) attempted suicide set-ups, to the grand scale of the film, where each character, or set of characters, is interlocking in different ways that has a small, but complex causal effect on the whole. Sometimes, these concatenations are more simultaneous than causal, as in the ingenious ""bedspring symphony"" near the beginning of the film. Appropriate to its ultimate subject matter, the visuals are focused on decay and dinginess. The delicatessen is filthy and the apartment building is falling apart. The tenants own a lot of broken things, and for those things that aren't broken, there's a good chance they'll get broken as the film progresses. (And by the way, if you love the production design and atmosphere of the film, and wouldn't mind seeing something with a similar mood, but serious instead of a surrealistic ""black comedy"" like Delicatessen, check out David Cronenberg's Spider (2002)). All the tenants have various eccentricities, often involving food. One of the most interesting tenants is an old man who decided to harvest his own meals by turning his apartment into a swamp, via regularly running water flooding the apartment, and inhabited by frogs and snails. He has a huge pile of empty snail shells stacking up in a corner. Water is a motif in the film--probably because of its relationship to food, as a means of necessary nourishment, although ironically, in a world characterized by food shortages, water is mostly wasted in the film. While not a depressing film (it wasn't to me, at least, although not that I dislike ""depressing"" films), Delicatessen isn't exactly uplifting, either, although there is a message of hope at the end, I suppose. It's definitely not for all audiences, but if you're a fan of Gilliam, Cronenberg, David Lynch, and similar directors, you should definitely try a meal at this Delicatessen.",0.0
1080,"good, but annoying; The film is spoilt by two major problems: 1 Terry Jones does an irritating falsetto as Brian's mother.He is also writer and director, and as usual this leads to a tendency to include dialogue and scenes which would be best left on the cutting-room floor. 2 The Monty Python regulars have several roles each, which makes the suspension of disbelief difficult.

1080,"This Will Make You A Better Person!; Monty Python are the grand masters of silliness, something they have elevated to an art over the course of numerous skits, shows and now a second feature film. For all the madness on display throughout this insane film, their greatest joke is that they have managed to create a genuine and priceless work of art. Life of Brian tells not the story of Jesus of Nazareth, but of the kid down the street, born on the same night in one of many hilarious twists on the the gospels. We catch up with him in his early thirties, as he gets caught up in religious fanaticism, terrorist plots and Roman repression. This sounds like the outline to a gritty historical epic, and Life of Brian's greatest strength is that it sticks pretty closely to a certain formula while exploiting the utter fundamental ridiculousness of every single situation, with an all-encompassing generosity that leaves nobody unscathed: organized religion takes a heavy hit, as do the feckless occupying Romans. The real genius of Life of Brian is that everything works on at least a dual level, and what is funny on the surface is often just as silly or even quite frightening at a deeper level. Consider one of the most classic scenes: women go to a stoning, a privilege their religion reserves to men, so they all buy fake beards in order to attend and participate... except all the actors playing women are played by men! So in that one representative example you have a biting indictment of religious double-standard, an unparalleled level of silliness, and some meta humor, all neatly bound together. The film glories in its own madness with such glee that it even manages not to rub your face in how clever it actually is, a very rare gift indeed! In this age of religious tension and political correctness, it is all the more precious to have a voice cry out and throw such well-aimed mud in all directions without discriminating. To so while being so entertaining is even more remarkable. This is essential viewing. Not only will it make you cry with laughter - one of the real pleasures worth living for - it will also raise important questions. And, however you choose to answer those, you will always have that unlikely staircase chase ending in an alien abduction, something so stupid even the Pope would have to crack a smile.",0.0

In this instalment, Wallace is struggling financially and decides to rent out a room to the public as a source of income, here we are introduced to one of Aardman's most ambitious characters, Feathers McGraw, a sinister and silent penguin criminal mastermind and the main antagonist. Meanwhile, It is also Gromit's birthday and he receives a gift from Wallace, a pair of 'techno trousers.' AKA 'The Wrong Trousers' After being forced out of his room and Wallace bonding with the penguin, Gromit feels sidelined and decides to move out. In a distressingly sad, overwhelmingly heartbreaking and gut- wrenching scene signifying the brief end to a deep bonding friendship. This then leads on to the penguin being able to commit to his evil deeds and use the naive Wallace as a way to steal a priceless diamond. This then later leads us too the brilliantly created train-chase sequence (arguably one of the best third acts ever), adding bursts of tension and humour at the same time, before ending with a cheerful and crowd-pleasing finally. As an analysis for the short what sticks out the most is how so many of the crucial moments and impactful scenes are told through visual expression and gestures between the two silent characters, Gromit and Feathers. The tense stand-offs and battle of wits between the two to gain the upper-hand on one another lead to some of the best visual storytelling to date in any film. Overall, The Wrong Trousers packs humour, tension, visual storytelling, drama, action, adventure, and emotion (both love and rivalry) all into one 30 minute masterpiece. Each scene is relevant to the developing plot and the story with very little exposition used. The Wrong Trousers truly is Aardman's magnum opus and greatest achievement to date, being a milestone in both stop-motion and animation. 10/10",1.0
66097,"Classic spin on ""Be careful what you wish for""; What self-respecting kid hasn't, at one time or another, wished for a different set of parents - you know the kind who wouldn't make you brush your teeth or eat your vegetables, and who would let you play in the mud and stay up late at night and have every single thing your greedy little heart could ask for? Well, Coraline finds just such an alternate universe lurking in the corner of the rundown Victorian home that she and her consistently busy and utterly self-absorbed parents have just moved into - a magical world hidden behind a secret locked door where mice dance, cats talk and duplicate parents cater to a beloved child's every whim and fancy. But as the old adage says, ""Be careful what you wish for"" - and soon Coraline is discovering, much to her dismay, that this ""perfect"" world and these ""perfect"" parents may not be quite so perfect after all. Based on the book by Neil Gaiman, ""Coraline"" is one of the most enchanting and visually arresting films to have come our way in quite some time. Prime credit for its success goes to writer/director/production designer Henry Selick and his team of 3-D/stop-motion animation wizards who have created a world that is rooted in both reality and fantasy at one and the same time. The triumph begins with the heroine herself, a feisty, naturally curious, no-nonsense kid whom any viewer, regardless of age, will be immediately drawn to. As voiced by Dakota Fanning, Coraline is skeptical without being cynical, and her yearning for a mother and father who might actually pay a little attention to her could not be more universal in its appeal. Like all good fantasies made for kids, ""Coraline"" finds its truths in its central character - in a lonely child who has been ripped away from her friends, and whose parents are so intensely focused on their own adult interests that they have no time to enter into the world of childish things that naturally concern her (people can't even get her name right, since just about everyone insists on addressing her as Caroline). But all is not sweetness-and-light even in the bright and colorful ""other"" world that Coraline visits - not by a long shot. For the movie taps into many of those primal fears - of abandonment, of being seduced by evil with promises of goodies - that loom large in many of our most cherished folk stories and fairy tales. Thus, since ""Coraline"" does venture into some pretty dark places, it might prove more than a little disturbing for very young audiences. Older kids, on the other hand, will likely enjoy the creepiness and will surely find themselves rooting on this imaginative and resourceful little girl as she uses her courage and intellect to outwit those who would cause her harm. The animation is first-rate on every level. The characters, with their sharp angles and spindly protuberances, look at times as if they'd just stepped out of a Tim Burton production - and the somber, nightmarish setting, with its dark skies and gnarly trees, conveys that impression as well (not really much of a surprise, actually, since Selick was the director of Burton's ""Nightmare Before Christmas""). Yet, ""Coraline"" never feels derivative of other movies; it is instead a wholly original and beautifully crafted work in its own right - and one you would be foolish and improvident in the extreme to miss out on.",0.0
38038,"Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit; This fourth Oscar winner film for Nick Park is an excellent Plastercine film. I thought Chicken took a long time (4 years), this took 5, and one scene took one of those years! Anyway, Wallace (Peter Sallis) and Gromit are now Anti-Pesto, a service to eliminate the town of pests. Basically Lady Campanula Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter) has a rabbit infestation, and while capturing the bunnies, Wallace and Gromit make a bit of an enemy with Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes). When trying his new invention to stop bunnies love for vegetables Wallace causes a terrifying incident. They thought it was Hutch turning into a huge monster, or Were-Rabbit, but it was the opposite way, Hutch is becoming Wallace, and you can guess what's wrong with Wallace when the moon comes out. Also starring Peter Kay as PC Mackintosh, Nicholas Smith as Reverend Clement Hedges, Liz Smith as Mrs. Mulch and John Thomson as Mr. Windfall. Filled with fantastic gags and Plastercine effects, this is genuine fun for the whole family. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it won the BAFTA for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film and BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film, and it won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film. Wallace and Gromit were number 11 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, and the film was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good!",1.0
50005,"The most vivid tale I have seen; Although fights and battles are only good (comparing e.g. to Hero or House of Flying Daggers), the palace, amazing garments and jewelry captivated me (no comparison to anything). Under this colourful, shiny cover lays an interesting plot. The whole story is not complicated very much, but life of main characters became more and more mixed. The nearest a day to drive away evil, the worst things happen. I can't tell who is guilty. Beside the events are depressing, the way they sound like made me listen carefully, the way they look like did not allow me to blink. I was afraid I might miss a beautiful scene or subtle detail. It is absolutely worth to see. At least once.",0.0
3751,"One of my Childhood Favorites; When I was a kid, I practically ate this movie up as a kid, and watching now as a teenager, it still holds up very well. I've always admired stop-motion, and Aardman has always been quite gifted in crafting delightful characters, worlds and stories through the media. In the case with this film (which is their first feature-length film funny enough), it centers around a pack of chickens in a farm trying to escape said farm and live a peaceful life away from the cruel farmers who want to cook them to earn bigger profits. Along the way, a rooster accidentally lands in the farm, and he teaches them how to fly to escape said farmers. The result is a funny, charming, beautiful and at times emotional POW story that does great service to the likes of The Great Escape. What's well contrasted about the chicken coup is that it also feels like a prison, creating a sense of terror and suspense for the chickens. Adding on to a well layered story, the jokes are very witty and add some spunk and charm to the characters. However, the film is also not afraid of getting dark, as whenever the farmers are near the chickens, you can only pray that those hens will get out of there alive. The attempts at sentimentality hit very well as we feel for the main hen Ginger and her goal to leave her horrid life and to get out and find a new home, something that many people stuck in horrible lives wish to fulfill. Most if not all the characters are just delightful. Ginger is the smartest of all the chickens, is always thinking up each plan, and while she does have her disagreements with Rocky the rooster, they do grow more fond of each other and it's very sweet whenever they bond. Speaking of Rocky, while his arch is the typical liar revealed story line you'd find in other films, he does grow a soft side for the hens and his snarky attitude only fits in to how charming he is. As for the other hens, they range from amusing and smart witted like Gabs and Mac to more stubborn like Bunty and Fowler, but that fits in to the contrasting views of what they can do to escape. Oh yeah, and the rats Nick and Fletcher are madly amusing and do help the chickens out, so they're good in my book. And then there's Mrs. Tweedy, the co-owner of the chicken farm and wife of the absent-minded albeit occasionally demanding Mr. Tweedy. She is so threatening from her appearance that whenever she's on screen, she gives me goosebumps. Add on her ferocious dogs and you've got a villain who will stop at nothing to get what she wants, and in this case, to turn all her chickens into pies to gain higher salaries...seriously, don't mess with Tweedy. Technical wise, this movie is marvelous. The sets look well detailed, the characters are in the usual simple yet amusing Aardman style, the effects are superb, and the flying scenes are just...stellar. Even though this was Aardman's first feature film, they went all out in crafting a great setting for where the film's core is, and they never hold back in giving the characters such unique and layered body expressions. Oh, and the gravy machine....pure masterpiece. And last but certainly not least, the music score. Harry-Gregson Williams and John Powell tangle with an upbeat lively score and a more suspenseful heist score that really add to the tension of each scene. There are many solid works in England when it comes to animation, and Chicken Run is no exception. While the liar revealed story and the occasional dodgy character play afloat, the film's solid animation, lovable cast of characters, well layered story, and charming score really make it a solid flick worth watching. If you have a kid of your own, pass this film on to them, and maybe then they'll have a favorite of theirs from their childhood that they'll stay forever attached to.",0.875
38038,"A smashing return of Wallace and Gromit; Wallace and Gromit is back and this time they're not window cleaners. They run Pesto, a company that provide service to the people of the town that need protection from rodents that feast on their vegetables. This all due to the annual upcoming vegetables competition. It's all jolly good until a were rabbit with a menacing appetite surfaces. From there on it's pretty much a joyride with well written puns and hilarious great parodies ranging from King Kong, Evil Dead, Matrix and Werewolf flicks in general. The movie is excellent in all regards and the clay characters of this movie contribute to making the characters more human than those of the animated counterparts. Far better then Chicken Run and more back to the greatness of Creature Comforts and the original Wallace and Gromit series. It's great for all ages and should be seen by all.",1.0
6493,"Very Good If You Like Romantic Comedies; I am not much of a Romance guy, but someone who is a fan of Romantic Comedies will definitely enjoy ALEX AND EMMA. Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson act out the lead rolls, so needless to say the acting is great, and with Rob Reiner directing, you can't go wrong! The film has a pretty good plot to it. It is about a writer by the name of Alex Sheldon, who owns 100,000 dollars to some Colombian gangsters. At first we are not quite sure why he owes so much money, but we do know that he only has 30 days to finish his book and get the money before they come back to kill him. This is a problem, because he has writers block. So he calls a young lady named Emma in to dictate his book. As he begins to tell her what to type, the book comes onto the screen showing us in story forum what happened to him and why he owes so much money. This film really isn't my kind of thing, but I liked it for what it was, so that means that anybody who enjoys Romantic Comedies should love this movie.",0.0
50005,"absolutely ridiculous; Zhang Yimou's third journey into martial arts territory shows an honest attempt to improve the story side, but it's still an over-the-top, over-produced mess which is hampered by zero character development, laughably bad histrionics, and complete reliance on spectacle. Adapted from ""Thunderstorm"" by Cao Yu (transplanted into the Tang Dynasty rather than 1930s China), as well as borrowing liberally from Shakespeare, Yimou drops us right into the middle of a major family feud without any setup or backstory. The term ""family feud"" is really an understatement as this family is totally screwed up. Rather than go into detail and give away any potential spoilers, let's just say that the emperor (Chow Yun-Fat) and empress (Gong Li) don't get along, to put it mildly. What follows is a series of affairs, incestuous relationships, murder, intrigue, double crossings, triple crossing, and quadruple crossings. Sounds good? Not on your life. Things don't develop naturally because Yimou robbed us of real characters. As such, these ""shocking revelations"" come at us like a series of knuckle balls, bashing us in the face not because they're truly shocking or even all that surprising, but because they're hammed up in grand soap-operatic fashion. It's sure to elicit more than a few chuckles and boisterous fits of laughter as characters tremble, cry, scream, and then tremble some more as these Perry Mason-esquire revelations come to light. Gong Li, a talented actress in every sense of the word, is reduced to playing second fiddle to her impressive cleavage. She's given little room to breathe and no room to act or develop her character beyond that of another tragic victim. Chow Yun-Fat, also making his long-awaited return to Chinese cinema, is sorely misused as he spends most of the film sitting down looking menacing, that is until he whips off his belt to deliver some unintentionally funny discipline. The visuals, impressive indeed, ultimately prove too garish and distracting in a film that features the most over-the-top performances in years. Cao Yu's original work was notable in part because of the well drawn characters and heartbreaking interactions, but Yimou (again) seems more concerned with that elusive Oscar rather than actually telling a compelling story with engaging characters. Strangely enough, the fundamental theme behind the film, that what is golden on the outside is rotten within, seems to also describe not only this waste of celluloid, but other lame attempts by Feng Xiaogang (The Banquet) and Chen Kaige (The Promise) to duplicate the success of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (which I don't even think is a very good film). All of these hack directors need to STOP making films, because they have clearly forgotten how.",0.0
38038,"Wallace and Gromit against all...; ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" is an Animation movie in which we watch Wallace and his loyal dog, Gromit who are trying to solve the mystery of garden sabotage which threatens the annual giant vegetable growing contest. Also we observe Wallace and Victor Quartermaine fight for the love of Lady Campanula Tottington. I liked this movie because it's a different kind of Animation movies that we watch nowadays and the plot of it's really good. Also about the cast it has to be mentioned that Peter Sallis (Wallace and Hutch) and Ralph Fiennes (Victor Quartermaine) voices were really one of the best selections for this movie characters and I believe that they really fit on them. Also the voice of Helena Bonham Carter who ""played"" as Lady Campanula Tottington was equally good selection. Finally I have to say that ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" is a must see movie for Animation fans and I believe that from this movie we can gain many things.",1.0

Also the plotline is VERY bloody good and blends beautifully with the comedy so zanily provided by the lord of funnymen Jim Carrey. Anybody in the critics section who tries  to say that this film is stupid and immature needs to grow up themselves as they were proably just pi***ed off at the fart jokes and felt insulted to hear such 'VILE language'.

2302,"Very funny movie; When two New York youths (""youts""), William Gambini (Ralph Macchio) and Stan Rothenstein (Mitchell Whitfield) are arrested and charged with murder in a Southern town, it is up to Willy's cousin Vinny (Joe Pesci) who is a lawyer and his beautiful girlfriend Mona Lisa Vito (Marisa Tomei) to defend them against a serious judge and the death penalty. It doesn't help their case that Vinny has never defended a murder case before or that he can't sleep because of outside noises near his hotel. My Cousin Vinny is a witty comedy that works on several levels. It incorporates different styles of comedy with a witty script that succeeds in making it funny. The chemistry between Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei is hilarious and the altercations between Fred Gwynn and Joe Pesci very funny. The acting in this movie is great by all parties, not just Pesci and Tomei, which has been commented on before. But I like Fred Gwynn's role as the judge, and Lane Smith's as the DA, as well. I've watched this one several times and haven't been bored by it once. The witty script, great acting and fun plot all make it work.",0.0
1148,"#5th Best Movie of all time, was it not for its painfully short running time; Wallace and Gromit movies belong to the few movies that actually deserved being called masterpieces. Lots of time and effort went into the claymation, and it looks better than ever! Wallace, the kind of stupid but very good-hearted, balded inventor, and his fateful, very smart dog, Gromit, are two of my all-time favorites. And the rest of the character gallery! Feathers McGraw, the penguin without a conscience! Wendolene, the wool saleswoman who falls in love with Wallace but -alas!- is allergic to cheese! And Preston, the evil dog, who is more than he appears! Anyway, the plot for this too short story is: Wallace needs money, so he rents out Gromit's room for visitors. A penguin up to no good takes the room, and Gromit gets jealous when Wallace becomes a great pal with the penguin and seems to forget his dog. So Gromit leaves to stay on the street, and this is indeed very tragic. Meanwhile ""something"" is planning stealing a diamond from the city museum. The great plot twist in this movie is when we find out who, or what, the ""chicken"" really is... Watch it!

Some movies that try this style are a bore, but Triplets is enjoyable because of its solid pace and great animation. Its best aspect is its style - characters and objects are portrayed in cartoonish, amusing ways. A biker has a huge nose, tall, emaciated body, and bulging legs like biceps. A tiny, wealthy man is protected perfectly between square, identical body guards. They're pretty creative images, and they're shown throughout the film. It also has some pretty good jokes, without needing words to set them up. A small nitpick is the caricatures seen in America. All of the background characters are obese. I'm not offended by it, but considering the ingenious designs in the rest of the movie, Triplets was picking at low-hanging fruit. But that's a minor grievance.

50005,"Two thumbs up!!; Just saw this film at a cinema near to my home in Wuhan China.I rated it very high because it is the first film in the last three years which can tell a story so smoothly. After the first Hollywood movie The Fugitive(lead actor Harrison Ford) was admitted in my country, the Chinese films changed forever by the affections of Hollywood movies. But the Chinese film makers did not know how to tell a story in the Hollywood way. Especially the film makers wanted to make BIG movie (the movie making cost high) to gain the high profit in the market, but in the same time they seemed like they forget how to tell a good story. But Chinese audience is very tolerable, they watch they comment and they despise. After all these years' BIG films' bombing, I watched a good story telling film, why should I not be satisfied? Disscusing this film in the technique way is not the important thing. All this years the BIG films all packed by the advanced techniques, but inside is a garbage.(sorry for the rude word, I can not say a better word for my poor English) Somebody (maybe a lot of foreign people) may want to watch more KongFu in Chinese films. But what I want to say is KongFu is not the only part of Chinese Culture, in fact it never was the major part of Chinese Culture in the past three thousand years. I can say it because I know our country and her history. The relationship and interaction of characters is the major part of film . This film is based on a novel Thunder Storm by Chao Yu in 40s of 20th century, and the background is changed to about 9th century.For the solid story by Chao Yu, the film is brilliant. And the success of this film is also a victory of Chinese writers. It proved that the real good novel can live all the time. Thank you for read this.",0.0
1080,"Life Of Brian; My first film with the entire crew from Monty Python (their third feature-length film), whilst I count out Terry Gilliam's TIME BANDITS (1981, a 7/10), which is sort of a post-break-up solo activity (in spite of Cleese and Palin's participation). What can I say? Due to the cultural disparity, comedy maybe the most possible film genre which is predisposed to feel outdated, especially for those from non-native audience. I could only squeeze some scattered laughter to cater for the film, which is a parody of the life of Jesus Christ grafted in a mistaken Messiah with a hotchpotch of haphazard mess and ridicule. Maybe the film should have a default setting for its viewers, because being an agnostic, I could hardly get the film, thus there is a possibility if one acquires more religious backdrops, there is a chance he or she could appreciate it more. Also it is a perplexing question mark in my mind, how could this film manages a 8.2 out of 10 rating and listed among top 250 in IMDb? (I had the same doubt when encountering THE PRINCESS BRIDE 1987, a 6/10). So back to the film itself, the acting is fairly passable (John Cleese and Michael Palin are hilarious in their deadpan performances, but the mis-pronunciation gags are a bit over- abused). Among all the intentional tricks, the paragraphs of pursuing the Messiah and Eric Idle's rib-tickling Loretta are my picks. It is no surprise this religious satire would provoke some blasphemy controversy, but the nerves and unconventionality are what should be admired, but if we separate the film from any context liaisons, the film is merely a modest farce, take the example of the ending, when the crucifixion scenes arrive, a sudden bathos ultimately reduces any putative knockout accompanied by the schmaltzy rendition of ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE (which I find enjoys a more suitable circumstances in AS GOOD AS IT GETS 1997).",0.0

I saw this because Alan Parker made one of my favorite movies ever (Angel Heart - but Parker also made a lot of lesser films) and because Gene Hackman -one of the most natural and effortless actors of all time- plays in it (and I rarely see a movie for the actor). Hackman plays the lead with a very young Dafoe and both do an excellent job as well as the rest of the A-level cast (R Lee Ermey, Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky, Frances McDormand & Michael Rooker). I found the movie very entertaining and it never fails to keep your attention.

8838,"Absorbing, thought-provoking character study; In a day and age where technology is so advanced, it seems mainstream films that focus more on character than things pleasing to the eyes are more scarce. When you go to the movies a lot of the trailers showcase things like explosions, beautiful people who look perfect, and eye-popping effects. This is not to say character driven films are now non-existent on the big screen, or that films which put more emphasis on other things besides character can't be worthwhile. But it just seems that the mainstream audience isn't interested so much in character study these days. There truly is a place for films with substance and ones that are meant to entertain us for a couple hours and let's hope it stays that way. It's directors like Martin Scorsese that keep films with three dimensional characters alive. Pros: Fantastic performances all around, each actor creating a memorable character. Intelligent direction and writing. Fabulous cinematography that really captures the Southwestern United States. Often funny. Well-paced. Riveting from the start. Some powerful dramatic and sometimes startling moments. All involved do a great job of making this so real and gritty. Cons: Somewhat dated. Final thoughts: As of this writing Mr. Scorsese's most recent film 'Shutter Island' is in theatres and has done quite well. Goes to show that there is still an interest in films with more to them than things pretty to look at. 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore' holds up extremely well and is truly a great piece of movie-making. My rating: 5/5",0.0
4326,"A sad story, A great Movie; Mississippi burning shows Gene Hackman at his best and at his side is Willem Dafoe who also plays very strong. Mississippi Burning is a dramatic movie made in 1988 directed by the talented Alan Parker (who has also directed Fame and Midnight Express). The lead roles are played by Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe and Frances McDorman is at her best playing a supporting role. The movie is based on the true story of the murder of three civil rights workers in 1964, so the movie is set in 1964 Mississippi. The movie begins with the three civil rights workers who are brutally murdered; the viewer now already knows that the police are involved. Allan Ward and Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe) are sent to Mississippi to shed some light on the case. The two agents have very different personalities, Rupert Anderson used to be a sheriff in a small Mississippi town, just like the town where they are investigating missing civil right workers, he does not like to do everything by the book, in contrary to Allan Ward, he is a hard working FBI agent who likes to do everything by the book. Not long after they enter the town they see that it will not be easy, the townspeople are very hostile towards them and the KKK is involved, Mr. Ward soon ask for more FBI agents, even when Mr. Anderson thinks it is a bad idea. Soon there are an enormous amount of FBI agents in the small town, but that only makes the townspeople angrier. The KKK set a church for black people on fire to scare the black people into not talking to the FBI, when Ward and Anderson walk into a restaurant and try talking to a black person he says: ''I have nothing to say to you'' but still the townspeople beat him up for talking to people from the FBI. The FBI agents search trough the endless swamps and find the car of the civil rights workers, but they still find no bodies. Agent Anderson feels a connection with the wife of the deputy sheriff and feels that she knows something but she won't tell anything. When Ward lets Anderson do it his way they finally see what really happened. The acting in Mississippi Burning is close to brilliant, Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are both good actors, but together they are brilliant. Gene Hackman is born for the role of an old Mississippi sheriff who knows how it all works. Gene plays very dominant and the scene in the bar where he threatens the townspeople is one of the best moments in the movie, because you don't expect it from him but still it fits him very well. Frances McDorman plays the cop who does everything by the book excellent, even his appearance, the glasses and his pale skin. Especially the scene where Anderson beats someone up in the barber shop you see that this goes against his principles. The music in Mississippi Burnin is phenomenal; there are a lot of gospel songs for example the song by Vesta Williams '' Try Jesus ''. The soundtrack is by Lannie Spann McBride, she made the very powerful song ''Walk On By Faith''. There is also a tune in the film when something bad is about to happen, when you hear it for the first time in the movie recognize the tune immediately, when you hear it you feel uncomfortable and are at the tip of your seat. Also Kitty Wells and Mahalia Jackson have made songs for the movie which are all beautiful. This movie is a beautiful movie with a perfectly cast. The music is very well made and used. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are a perfect duo and should do more movies together, they fit the term '' good cop bad cop '' perfectly as Gene Hackman really does look as a hardened, bad cop and Dafoe as good cop. What they shouldn't have done was basing it on a real story, because clearly the director didn't want to be restrained, because a lot was different in the movie than what really happened, only a couple of things are historically correct, asides from that it's a must watch, I give this movie an 8 or 9 out of 10, so a small 9 out of ten.",0.0

As I sit here remembering the movie, the scenes wash through my mind, and there is nothing I can recount here that would make any sense. Caro has done nothing else I've heard of. Jeunet wrote and directed (in the American English titles) ""A Very Long Engagement,"" ""Amelie,"" and ""The City of Lost Children,"" all of which I've seen, and ""Alien 4"" (also known as ""Alien: Resurrection""), which I've seen parts of as I've surfed the channels. ""Delicatessen"" is nothing like them, nothing like anything else you've seen. Ultimately it's a series of more or less loosely connected skits that are fall off your chair hilarious, tied together in building with a street-level deli and people renting rooms on the five or so floors above. The originality of the scenes is unequalled.",0.0
1175,"Masterpiece; If Citizen Kane is the number one movie to see to learn anything about cinematography, this might as well be at number 2. Delicatessen succeeds at creating a totally separate, consistent and believable universe with a very distinct atmosphere. The brown and green colors add to the weirdness of this universe. Is it horror? Yes and no. Is it a comedy? Yes and no. Is it brilliant? Oh yes! Everybody involved in the making of this picture gave it its best. The camera work is brilliant, the sets are simply amazing (with the final bathroom scene at the pinnacle), the editing and pace is breathtaking. This could have been a very dark movie (and I guess a few Hollywood directors would have tried to turn it into a splatter movie and fail miserably), but the humor is just light, off-beat and hilarious enough to make it into a consistent and bearable whole. Every universe has its humor, and a strange universe has strange humor. Jacques Tati would have loved Delicatessen. Julie's 'tea ceremony' without her glasses, the mattress spring test, Aurore's failing suicide contraptions, it's all funny as hell. I hope everyone who is even marginally involved in making movies gets to see Delicatessen and learns from its greatness. We could sure use a touch of genius in most of them ... 10/10",0.0
38038,"Best Animated Film Of 2005!; Having just come home from my third viewing of The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit, I decided to jump on IMDb and see what others thought. I noticed a lot of Brits loved it, while those in America just didn't get it. That really doesn't come as any shock, as America doesn't get what ""English"" is. Wallace and Gromit are very English. Middle class English, in fact, with a hint of eccentricity throw in for good measure. The film is a lot like our two heroes; simple and unassuming. It has a nice and gentle plot so the children don't get lost, yet there's enough beef there to keep the adults amused too. There's some light innuendo (which seems have to have offended the evangelic - oh noes, drama!) but there is nothing more rude than a bottom for a brief moment. When people get offended by a plasticine anus, you know the world's messed up... One quick note to those (all American so far that I have seen) who think Chicken Run is a better film: Chicken Run was made to pander to your sense of humour, and I think it suffered because of it. Curse of the Were Rabbit is witty, English, and intelligent. Thomas The Tank Engine's film was ruined because it was made to please the Americans and I'm glad Nick Park did not let that happen to another Great British institution. To sum up: You can keep your Chicken Runs, your Shreks, your Madagasga's - that kind of crude, crass, slapstick comedy just doesn't compare to the wit and grace that is Wallace and Gromit in Curse of the Were-Rabbit. English to the core, and long may Wallace and Gromit stay that way.",1.0
71057,"Any Way You Look At It, 9 Just Didn't Add Up; Believe me, I'm really trying to be fair-minded here, but, the truth is, when it comes to 9's painfully predictable story, its sheer lack of originality was a severe compromise simply for the sake of an overload of CGI effects. Containing way-way too many mechanical-monster attacks, 9 was the sort of movie that would probably best appeal to people who actually like to have their intelligence repeatedly insulted. This $30 million production (that shamelessly had Tim Burton's name attached to it as an underhanded marketing ploy) arrogantly talked about the ""human soul"" and actually had the gall to suggest that, due to this, its story was so much deeper than just being a sum total of all of its near-endless explosions. I clearly got the impression that lurking behind all of 9's bleak, post-apocalyptic nonsense there was some sort of biblical message in its ""rag-dolls-on-the-run"" story. But I got too bored with this picture to even bother to try to second-guess its ulterior motives. It really figures that 9 was directed by Shane Acker who was also the same hack responsible for Oz, The Great and Powerful. I couldn't believe that Acker actually stooped to using the classic song - ""Over The Rainbow"" (sung by Judy Garland) in 9 as a truly slimy means of hoping to add some much-needed credibility to the worthlessness of this film's hokey, shallow, haywire story-line.",0.0

But, I have to say, that I'm 14, and even though it was rated PG, I STILL was creeped out a little bit. The friends that I saw it with were creeped out too. I would say 12 and up... not for children. But back to the review. I LOVED IT!! I didn't want it to be over!!!! Almost nothing was changed from the book, except for some events that happened and different times (like when Coraline receives the stone with the hole in it), AND for the Wybie character, which wasn't even in the book at all, and I thought there was really no point to it. And why the crazy old man was blue I'll never know.... The animation was almost perfect!!! For a stop-action or stop-motion (whatever it's called) film, the flow of it was seamless. I loved the movie. Everything about it. If it got off track from the book, it somehow found a way to get right back on track. This movie was a visual masterpiece. I still can't believe someone actually made this into a movie, seeing as the book wasn't so popular, so a huge thanks for the people that made one of my favorite books to one of my favorite movies =.

While certainly this film will not be everyone's cup of tea, I cannot recall anyone I know seeing it and not being delighted. No other movie I've seen so far could top this one for its combination of wittiness, dark humor, love for detail and collection of regular people holding a mirror up to each and everyone of us, showing us how strange we really are. Indeed this movie will not be constrained by a classification as romance, comedy or science fiction or horror. It is much more than the sum of these - it is a work of art and the painstaking work and love for detail which Jeunet & Caro have put into it show everywhere you look.

At times it is perhaps disturbing to an audience who regard themselves as morally right and civil, to see such a benign and malignant setting. An interesting view on a post-apocalyptic world, indeed one that hasn't been delved in before and presented in Jeunet's distinctive style that is seen repeated in several other films such as Alien Resurrection and Amelie, jointly created though of course with the art director, Caro. Originality is definitely something that goes with this film hand in hand along with plenty of hilarious moments such as the failed suicide attempts (I say hilarious.. It is a black comedy after all!) And the bizarre rhythmic sex scene. Trying to describe the film in any detail would not only ruin the image of what it is but would also prove to be an extremely difficult task due to the wacky sets, actors(Those wide lenses again by Jeunet) and overall narrative.

Unfortunately, they can't find them. Then they come back one more time because they forgot to check somewhere, and they come out with a spoon. Why can't people be that clever anymore?

38038,"worth it for the claymation, story is a little long; This movie is worth seeing mostly for the brilliant claymation, which, in the present day computer dominated world of animation, is refreshingly old school. No doubt there is some usage of computers, but for the most part it's good old painstaking frame by frame manipulation of figurines. I can't imagine the amount of work involved in making a 90 minute feature film in claymation, and for that and the brilliant techniques I applaud this film. The film is the third (fourth?) installment of the lovable Wallace and Grommit characters. The first few minutes will have you chuckling at the buck toothed British stereotypes, but after a while the chuckles fade slightly. There are no outright side splitting moments, but a lot of cutesy jokes. The story is pretty well told but i find W & G work better as a short film subject, there's only so many times you can laugh by seeing people with goofy faces smile.",1.0

745,"A shift into darker themes- while retaining plenty of charm, humour and entertainment for everyone.; The final part of the original Wallace & Gromit trilogy. A Close Shave packs the charm, humour and love that we had for the previous two in an all new adventure. This third part gives us a shift in tone and change of theme, briefly delving into horror and thriller elements (intended as a parody) while retaining its comedic and childish subject matter. The story follows Wallace's latest line of business, window-cleaning and his collection of quirky new inventions. While on a job he meets Wendoline, a local shop- keeper in which the two become very attached, and also her mysterious and silent pet dog, Preston. Gromit, instantly becoming suspicious of Preston begins to investigate him after a sheep, escaped the previous night from the truck he was driving and broke into their home. Gromit is then later framed by Preston for being a sheep killer and is imprisoned for life. Separating him from Wallace in a similarly emotional scene to The Wrong Trousers. After Wallace with the help of the escaped sheep (Shaun) bust out Gromit and later come across Preston and Wendoline in a field, sheep- rustling they chase them down before Wallace and Wendoline become trapped and leaving Shaun and Gromit to save the day. After a final showdown, the film closes with Wendoline and Wallace parting ways (after humorously she dislikes cheese. Also noting she isn't a good fit due to her criminal behaviour.) While A Close Shave is generally a family-friendly and fun film to all to enjoy. Unlike it's predecessor it does have a few flaws. The first being too many sub- plots which seem to overcrowd the story, leaving to scenes such as Wendoline and Wallace's relationship and Gromit's imprisonment feeling rushed and under developed. Furthermore, the final showdown between Preston and Gromit felt underwhelming, making Preston's intimidating and dominating presence feel diminished. However, A Close Shave definitely deserves praise for its shift into darker themes while keeping it's childish humour and wit, as well as the introduction of more beloved characters such as Shaun the Sheep. 8/10",1.0

It took what seemed to be a simple story and turned it into a complex tale about rebellion, survival, love, and the desire to be free.  Peter Lord and Nick Park, the same chaps who brought us the wonderfully imaginative ""Wallace and Gromit"" series, have once again used claymation as an effective tool in telling a great story.  Although it's very kid-friendly, it seems at times to be aimed at an adult audience.  As far as I can tell, I think adult movie-goers will appreciate this film a lot more than the kids will.

I have the nagging feeling that the production values were perhaps TOO good on this one, though, as such lending the film an inappropriately solemn feel even as you're doubling up on the floor laughing at one of the team's astute observations.  I suspect if the Pythons were at their peak today, the resulting 'spoof' would have been much sharper and less gentle. Still, who really has the right to complain when such gems as ""Blessed are the Cheesemakers!"" are still present?  It is this and many other classic moments that make this a joy to watch time and time again, even if its more devoted fans may have fallen victim to the very thing the film lampoons - hailing the wrong Messiah.

The formula-based story was a shock to me, and I was waiting the entire movie for a twist, or at least something odd. I struggled with the length of the movie in terms of the story - it didn't support 1 hour 40 minutes. I would have preferred a shorter 1 hour story and perhaps 2 shorter 20 minute deals. Technically, Wallace and Gromit had a lot of the charming attention to detail that you would come to expect from Nick Park. Seeing it on the big screen really made the fingerprints stand out, especially on Gromit. But who cares? It's plasticine, after all. For me, it's always refreshing to see a stop-motion film.

Yes, the idea is that another man (Brian) is mistaken for the Messiah-but the story's big flaw is that the real Messiah is already present, briefly shown giving a sermon to a crowd. On top of that, there is nothing about Brian that would convince anyone he was the Messiah; he doesn't even pretend to be one. This gives the whole movie a contrived atmosphere. The other scenes are hardly funny either. The Jews who plot against the Romans ask what the Roman occupiers have done for them, and as the scene goes on, the speaker amasses a list of benefits brought by the Romans. In a way, this glorifies colonialism and fails to explain why natives invariably come to despise their occupiers. There were plenty of reasons for the Jews to hate the Romans, but that is hardly brought up. Also, other jokes such as ""Biggus Dickus"" and Pontius Pilate not being able to say the letter ""R"" are juvenile without being funny.

Marty lives his young life, he never tires of telling us, between the pulpit of the catholic church and the altar of Hollywood. Sirkian silk nudges us toward a three handkerchief melodrama, a window on the world of women. From the repressed desire of bourgeois marriage to the menstrual phantasies of 'Wizard Of Oz', 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore' excessively locates the male vision of the female entirely within the cinematic mythos. That Scorsese chooses his trompe aural through the medium of a young boy's relationship to his mother can be no accidental opening. So we have the entirely 'staged' overture, Alice wanders through a deserted Minnelli soundstage, the little house on the prairie set for nostalgic effect gives way to the quintessential Hitchcock opening, a high crane (?) shot glides effortlessly through a suburban landscape, setting a milieu, implying a social setting that is thwarted by the innocent movement becoming voyeuristic. Every second of this opening is an homage to classical cinema, not the obvious self reflexivity of 'The Bad and The Beautiful' but self reflexive nevertheless. ""Look at this"" it says, ""take part in this world of truth and illusion"" .

(They even took time for things like designing and filming one of the cleverest opening credit sequences I've seen.) Jeunet's films are a feast of color and sound, where almost every character is memorable in his/her own way. The plot is simple, but why complain? The directors have created an entire world for us to enjoy, filled with quirky people (the suicide woman, the guys who make animal-noisemakers...for whom?), weird set design (there must be a plumbing fetishist on the crew), and painstakingly-created set pieces (the flood, the fight on the roof, the squeaky bed).

50005,"Murderous imperial melodrama, but sumptuous and visually stunning. With Gong Li and Chow Yun Fat; Curse of the Golden Flower (Man Cheng Jin Dai Huang Jin Jia) is gorgeous melodrama; a visual feast of scarlet, gold and magenta, of lush set pieces with thousands of characters (computer generated but still impressive), of armies of men wearing yellow, scarlet or iron- colored armor...but melodrama all the same. In Tenth Century China, the Emperor Ping (Chow Yun Fat), ruthless and malevolent, is slowly poisoning the Empress Phoenix (Gong Li), ruthless and determined, with an extract from a fungus which will drive her insane before she dies. They have three sons. There is the Crown Prince Xiang, somewhat weak, who has been having an intimate affair with his mother for a couple of years. There is the second son, Prince Jie, who is capable and torn between fealty to his father and responsibility to his mother. And there is the youngest son, Prince Chang, scarcely more than a teen-ager, always happy and ready to please, usually ignored by both parents, and a young man who hides his resentments. The Empress knows she is being poisoned and puts into play a plot which will culminate during the Festival of the Chrysanthemum. A violent plot it is, with bloody consequences for everyone. But does this dysfunctional family with all the plotting and maneuvering really mean anything? Not much, in my view, except as a reason to create wonderful visual images without end, plus a chance to see two outstanding actors, Gong Li and Chow Yun Fat, show why they're so good. There are plenty of confrontations, secrets about first marriages and first wives, sword thrusts and choreographed duels and battles to keep most people happy. I had a grand time, but I was hungry two hours later. Most likely if this film by Zhang Yimou is remembered in twenty years, it will be because of its production values. The palace settings, despite the dark doings, are vibrant with color; there are bright, multi-hued columns, rugs and walls that virtually scream to be noticed, heavy and ornate costumes and sumptuous details, such as the golden hair-pins Gong Li wears and the small, translucent cup she drinks her poisoned medicine from. The attack by the Chinese equivalent of black-clad ninja warriors on an Imperial outpost in a canyon is great, choreographed action...dozens of these shadowy men rappelling down cliffs, using hooks and cables to slide down from great heights onto the roofs of the compound. In the dusk it looks like clouds of black raptors swooping from the sky. At the imperial palace a great circular pavilion is built looming over the immense square. When the square is filled with yellow chrysanthemums it looks like a vast golden plain. The climatic battle between the two forces on this golden field of chrysanthemum is filled with brightly uniformed men in the thousands, with huge wooden walls rolled into place that sprout spears and slowly move forward while arrows darken the sky. Afterwards, cleaning the square of all the bodies and blood and armor, then replacing the crushed flowers with new chrysanthemums, is nearly as impressive as the battle itself. It's great, engrossing stuff. The one false note was the occasional gymnastic sword play between actors. When you see a middle-aged woman suddenly doing backflips, or an aging emperor sitting on an ornate bench able to ward off blindingly fast front, back and side sword strikes, well, for me, I found myself amused, not amazed. When one considers the movies Zhang Yimou has given us -- among them Ju Dou, Raise the Red Lantern, Shanghai Triad, The Road Home, The Story of Qiu Ju -- he gets a free pass from me on this one. It's great fun and not much more, but enjoy.",0.0
66097,"Wonderfully animated; basically a 'modern' fairy tale...; If you like fairy tales, you will love this movie. This film has everything: story, funny characters, entertaining dialog, good scenes, beautiful animation and a nice moral. I loved Coraline. It's a very kind, but also mysterious movie about a young girl who, by pure curiosity, travels to a parallel dimension of her house. There she meets her 'other mother' and 'other father'. Everything is fantastic and everyone seems so nice. However, after awhile it becomes clear that a dark power is trying to lure Coraline away from her real family... There's so much to tell about this movie, but I think it's best that you go watch it yourself, before I spoil too much. Coraline is truly a wonderfully animated gem. It's a movie you will watch again and again over the years, maybe as an annual tradition! 9 out of 10 stars!",0.0
66097,"Fantastic fantasy, just that we have had such journeys in cinema long while ago.; Fantastic fantasy, just that we have had such journeys in cinema long while ago. From an Alice in Wonderland to many fairy tales, we have seen a girl jump into a fantasy world and explore it. The same happens with CORALINE, just that she says people as how she wants them to be. Having said that, this is by no measure bad cinema ad in fact it's interesting too. Just we need to be patient. The whole animation is done like the ones we used to see in our childhood and those were puppets used in stop-motion cinema, so we have wooden made faces here and not the standard animation. Well, the design and the look is not so appealing or to say the least gorgeous as it is old fashioned. Yet, a few aficionados of those good old times may like this. The cinematography is good and at times is just awesome in terms of the way we are revealed those things what Coraline sees in her adventure. The costumes too are well suited too, to make it look a but creepy and something that we are certainly willing to know. Above all, acting and the concept is one thing that ail make it a watch, if all else is something that we are not much interested in. Dialogues are just there as if we speak lines naturally and at times out of place too, so much praise to writing here. So that's mostly about it, a good animated film that is not a must watch but not a must miss either. Leaving it with a 3/5. Good.",0.0
1080,"Life Of BRIAN; Firstly, I can not believe they tried to ban this due to blasphemy. Anyone with a shred of intelligence will realise, it is not a story mocking Jesus or religion, but is just a comedy set around the Jesus era based on a man who is mistaken as a Messiah. Very early in the film this is established as Brian is part of a crowd actually listening to Jesus giving a speech to the people. If you enjoy the over-the-top comedy of this masterpiece, then you will undoubtedly enjoy Monty Python and the Holy Grail. With the Python boys from the series cast in many different roles, the cast is not the largest, but one of the funniest you will ever see. You soon forget you have just seen John Cleese playing the part of a rebel leader before he is cast to play a roman soldier on the lookout for the rebel leader and his gang. This shows the high level of acting involved. The comedy is still as fresh in 2005 as it was when it was made, and a must-see for any fan of John Cleese, Eric Idle and comedy in general.",0.0
66097,"Button Swoon; That's Coraline, pronounced 'Caw-a-lyne'. Seems the only people to get that right are Coraline's mum and dad. All four of them. Four? Well, after her family moves into the 'Pink Palaces Apartments', Coraline (Dakota Fanning) discovers a parallel dimension, accessed through a tiny door in reception. There she discovers a candy-coloured mirror world, in which parents mark II are never too busy to play. They prepare dinner tables laden with mouthwatering roasts (and a literal gravy train) and compose songs (They Might Be Giants-penned songs but, really, you can't have everything) on magic pianos, dedicated to the very ground on which Coraline walks. The kind of stuff her workaholic, self-absorbed real-world parents have neither the time nor inclination for. ""Rain makes mud, mud makes a mess"" Mom no. 1 (Teri Hatcher) snaps when Coraline wants to go out and splash around. Conversely, Other Mom (also Teri Hatcher) just adores mud, glorious mud. ""Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies...!"" Oh yes, the perfect parents in every way. Well, okay, there are the buttons. You're looking at the buttons, right. The black buttons Mom and Dad 2.0 have in place of their eyes. Maybe it is a bit yucky. Only now, Other Mom's insisting that Coraline has the same operation. And when she resists, things suddenly turn very nasty. As that mysterious talking cat (Keith David) warned her all along, ""You probably think this is a dream come true - but you're wrong."" And when Mom No.2 transforms into the awful spider-hag we guessed she was all along, Coraline must get herself, her real parents and some other trapped souls the heck out of this poisoned domain, before her eyes get poked out with sewing needles. Button Moon it ain't. This reviewer bows to nobody in their admiration for the works of Neil Gaiman, from the 'Sandman' saga to 'Stardust'. Though some may quibble that Coraline hasn't an original bone in its body - referencing everything from The Wizard Of Oz to Snow White's witch-queen and Alice's enchanted gardens (along with many elements from Gaiman's own Sandman novels) - there's only a handful of plots in this world, and the wise ones know it's all in the telling. As a weaver of myths and spinner of stories, then, Gaiman is at the top of his game, man. Director Henry Selick isn't exactly a slouch either when it comes to fashioning astounding vistas. Contrary to popular belief (and its, er, title) Tim Burton didn't actually direct Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas - it was Selick; another ex-Disney animator like Burton, and the chap behind the James and the Giant Peach adaptation. As expected - but even exceeding expectations - Coraline, the longest stop-animation feature to date, and the first to be shot in 3D, is technically brilliant. From the minute curl of an eyebrow to the sheen of dust on a window, the gilding and frosting is unprecedented. If the set-pieces (including that enchanted garden with its snapping snapdragons and praying mantis tractor) overwhelm with their ingenuity, the sideshows featuring Coraline's bizarre neighbours are hardly less impressive: a phantasmagorical big top of circus mice; a bawdy burlesque voiced by our own French and Saunders, featuring lithe young trapezists bursting through the skins of old ladies with bosoms like gas balloons, for an audience of flying Scottie dogs wearing harnesses of angels wings. It's a stream of consciousness turned loopy, feral and dangerous. And Coraline is terrifying. Unlike, say, WALL-E, which also springs from an essentially depressing set-up, this film isn't interested in charming your socks off. Like its eponymous heroine, it knows exactly who it is, and if you don't care for it, you can go to blazes. Or Hannah Montana: The Movie. Coraline has no warmth, no charm, no cheer - and it likes it like that. Its primary purpose is to make you crawl under a popcorn box, or tickle the same part of the brain that likes tiptoeing down the creaky cellar stairs - then bolting up the same. Why? Because kids can't get enough of it. Because, in the face of all currently received wisdom and advice - the kind of stultifying over-cautiousness that led to the likes of March Of The Penguins being saddled with a 'mild peril' warning - kids love 'icky stuff' and they love being scared out of their wits. As Gaiman argues, and everyone from Angela Carter to the Brothers Grimm would surely agree with him, this is healthy stuff, an important part of a child's development. Much less healthy, in fact, is the presence of local boy Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr), short for ""Why Be Born?"" of all the lovely things - a totally unnecessary addition to the source. In the original, Coraline calls on every ounce of her own courage and initiative to defeat the button-eyed 'Beldam'. Here, it's the otherwise entirely useless Wybie who saves the day, as if a mere girl couldn't be trusted to be self-sufficient. It all seems horribly representative of an increasingly reactionary, anti-feminist stance in American-made dramas, and which now appears to have extended its pernicious reach to family cartoons. The much-vaunted 3D is similarly problematic. Coraline's palate is vivacious and bright, but those dull grey glasses automatically cast a pall over proceedings, rendering clear scenes gloomy and muddy: a truly crackpot interference. Sure, it's meant to be dark, but not like this. The technology isn't nearly exploited enough anyway: after a tease of an opener in which sewing needles are perilously thrust towards the eyes, it consequently drops in and out, so that you might find yourself constantly taking the glasses off and on to get the most out of the picture. To be continually reminded of a technical process is not exactly ideal for such a supposedly immersive feature. But perhaps it should have dispensed with it altogether; Coraline's world is audacious enough on its own terms without further feathers and bells and whistles.",0.0
1175,"Excellent; This is simply beautiful. The title does give it justice as this movie is indeed a ""delicatessen"". A feast for the mind and eye, though this film is not for every one and you have to be patient for the plot to unveil, you have to be attentive with the details, as this is not a movie to watch if you are not in the right mood. It sets place in a building populated with a bunch of odd characters. They are all very strange but yet likable even though some of them are pure evil. You cannot identify in what city the movie takes place, or in what time period, all you know is that happens in France in a surrealist, apocalyptic background, when food sources were scarce and people must find alternative sources. I felt like the authors favored the vegetarians and portrayed the carnivores as crazy brutes driven by desire, capable to go to unbelievable lengths for their little piece of meat.

3751,"Something for everyone; Chicken Run is a wonderfully entertaining movie for EVERYONE!  Kids will love the eye-candy of chickens doing absurd things and tossing off silly one-liners.  Adults will enjoy the brilliantly funny dialogue and the sweet, engaging story.  Parents will enjoy taking their kids to a movie that does not have the Disneyesque product tie-ins and must-buy soundtrack.   Movie buffs can try to count the references to The Great Escape, Stalg 17, Star Trek and Braveheart and may be pleasantly surprised at the quality of the camera work. Nick Park, Peter Lord & Co. succeeded (where so many other have failed recently) in making an animated movie whose story, plot and dialogue are equal to the brilliant animation.  In the wordless opening minutes we are engaged and in invited to care about these silly chickens.  By the time the snappy dialogue gets rolling we've already identified with the chickens' plight.  It may be a bit slow through the middle for the younger moviegoers. But the sound of laughter, cheers and applause from the whole audience as the chickens make their final bid for freedom is well worth the wait.  The only sad part is we may have to wait another five years for another Aardman Animations to produce another picture of the quality.",0.875
50005,"Good movie spoiled by lousy subtitles; The one who did the English subtitles for this Chinese movie should have his balls ripped off and feed to the goats. Kidding aside, the subtitle's font are all white with no black to contrast it with the light hues prevalent in the movie. With 90% of the movie comprised of talking heads, all I get is a headache trying to follow the dialogue. Most expensive Chinese movie indeed, what a waste. By the way, I've watched it in a cinema in the Philippines. I don't understand the story much because of the stupid subtitle problem. What I gather from watching all the pretty pictures is that the plot is about a dysfunctional royal family. The power struggle between the Emperor (Chow Yun Fat) and the Empress (Gong Li) is quite convoluted but is expected in this kind of narrative. The cast all gave good performance but the acting of Gong Li is above par. Directed by Zhang Yimou, the one who handled one of my favorite film, Hero, still shows that he's the deal when it comes to sweeping cinematography. The sets and costumes are elaborate, the palette's rich. You have to see the interior and exterior of the imperial palace to see what I mean. Martial arts sequences are very much toned down, as compared to Hero, so if you're expecting this kind of fare you'll be disappointed. The director makes up for it during the last part of the movie when the armies of the different players clashed. You'll be amazed by the sheer number of extras and I don't think there's not much computer generated effects used here. Good movie but very much marred by ONE MAJOR technical issue in production. Maybe I should see it again when it comes out on DVD to read a better subtitle and appreciate it more.",0.0
19,"Okay, But It Pales In Comparison To The Original; Ace Ventura is one of those characters you either love or hate. I don't mind him too much and can put up with his silly faces and noises in moderation but I guess he gets on some peoples nerves. I originally saw this at the cinema in 1995 with my girlfriend and she continually told me that she was fed up with Jim Carrey's noises. When I was at school many many years ago, there was some kid who was always making funny noises and messing around in the playground. Some kids (such as myself) couldn't get enough of him whilst others stayed as far away as possible. You either love them or hate them. Back to the film. I don't think the story was as exciting as the original but it was good enough and did have some funny scenes in it although I would have liked to see a bit more of beautiful Africa in it. There is a good cast here and Carrey does seem to have chemistry with them. All in all, a ridiculous but enjoyable movie which can be enjoyed if you are in the right mood and can put up with Carrey's pranks.",0.0
2302,"One of the Best Scripts Ever Written; A homicide; a sleepy southern town is rocked to its very core. The lives of two innocent guys accused of murder are now the line. If they loose their case, the death penalty is a near certainty. What to do when the stakes are so high? Who can you truly depend on? Well family of course. Thus starts My Cousin Vinny, a fish-out-of-water courthouse procedural that just may be the most objectively lean and enjoyable scripts to ever come out of early 90's Hollywood. When cousin Vinny (Pesci) shows up, he's clad head-to-toe in black leather; hardly the look of a newly minted lawyer. He sniffs around, as if simultaneously amused and horrified by rural Alabama's quaintness. His fiancÃ©e Mona Lisa Vito (Tomei) snaps pictures on her pink Polaroid; equally beside herself though mostly she's concerned about the quality of the Chinese food. The two youts initially accused of murder are Stan Rothenstein (Whitfield) and Bill Gambini (Macchio), two New Yorkers initially taking in the American South in their '64 Buick Skylark. In desperation Bill suggests the duo turn to his cousin, a personal injury lawyer imbued with the ""Gambini"" flare for argument. At first glance, there is a lot to love about My Cousin Vinny. The film features a volatile mix of well recognized character actors including the boyish Ralph Macchio and the pitch-perfect casting of Fred Gwynne, Bruce McGill and Lane Smith as the judge, sheriff and prosecuting attorney respectively. Our two leads Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei are a revelation as two working-class urbanites struggling and failing to adapt to the inconveniences of loud sawmill whistles, rumbling trains and Alabama mud. Years after My Cousin Vinny's release, many have joked that Tomei's Supporting Actress win in 1993 was at best a fluke and at worst undeserved. Many have made the argument that her Lisa can be summed up as a floozy just south of Miss Adelaide only made useful because she comes from a line of grease-monkeys. Yet within the context of the script, Lisa isn't just a plot device but is arguably the strongest character in the film. She's haughty, high-maintenance and nagging for sure, yet her resourcefulness, wit and intelligence always shines through. Most people arguing about a leaky faucet do so with angry indignation yet come from her pitter-pat with Vinny, she's smart, concise, charismatic and even a little erotic. She's basically the whole package. None of this could be accomplished without a dead-on-balls script by Dale Launer whose previous scripts Ruthless People (1986) and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988) had a tailored affinity for good old- fashioned farce. My Cousin Vinny however is arguably Launer's best script to date. Every scene is the perfect balance between artfully disseminating information and tactfully piling on high and higher stakes all while being gut-bustingly hilarious. Most comedies would be so lucky to have a scene or two everyone knows and fondly remembers. My Cousin Vinny may just have to many to count. If there's one thing wrong with My Cousin Vinny it's in the directing. Don't get it twisted, director Jonathan Lynn isn't bad and gets the job done but one can't help but think the entire process as film is entirely reflexive. There's just nothing special about the film visually. It creaks and strains under the limitations of early 90's big studio film-making and fails to take advantage of its screenplay with similarly grappling camera-work. Much like the similar A Few Good Men (1992), My Cousin Vinny sadly looks and feels just a tiny bit dated. My Cousin Vinny is an incredibly tight and wondrously fun little tall-tale that does wonders with the dusty courtroom genre. Not a sour note is reached among the cast which all run away with their roles and what's more, they seem to be having a lot of fun doing their thing. If I ever taught a class on screen writing, I'd show My Cousin Vinny in the first week and celebrate it as a near-perfect example of good mainstream movie writing. After all, the film is already being used as a tool for young trial lawyers.",0.0

That's been a favorite of mine in these last few years. Anyway it reminded me a little of Oh God for obvious reasons, the references to God, and the thought provoking quality mixed with wit and intelligent comedy. Oh God was one of my favorite comedies growing up. It definitely is the kind of comedy that doesn't get made anymore unfortunately. I have yet to read the other reviews of this and hope to find some tens besides me, because while this was by and large a comedy, it was a delightful one and one that still lingers in my thoughts which is obviously why I decided to do a review. Comedies, when they are perfectly made, deserve 10's. This is a 10 and one of the most thought provoking and beautiful comedies ever made. I am sure there are many growing up now, whole hosts of people, who have yet to discover this and I hope they do, particularly those who are fans of Bruce Almighty and are not aware of this wonderful movie from the 70's.

1148,"""The Wrong Trousers"" is filmmaking history that may never be paralleled; Wallace & Gromit: The Wrong Trousers (1993): Calling this delightful and hilarious Oscar-winning masterpiece (brought to us by Nick Park, co-director of ""Chicken Run,"" one of my all-time favorite films) the best claymation short ever is a lot like saying that someone just bought the best vehicle from a used car lot, so I'll go ahead and call this the best animated short ever, which it definitely is. No questions asked. It's brilliantly shot, paced, scripted, directed...to paraphrase Mary Poppins, it's practically perfect in every way.  You can't help but fall in love with every single character on the screen, from our always-lovable cheese-loving inventor and his loyal canine companion to even the devious jewel-thieving penguin Feathers McGraw (the subject of the bestselling ""Have You Seen This Chicken?"" T-shirts). They are so well-rounded that Feathers nearly steals the show; it's impossible to keep a straight face at the sight of a penguin nervously wiping sweat from his brow, disguising himself as a chicken and firing a revolver, all while wearing the same stolid expression in his little peppercorn-black eyes. The wild train ride near the conclusion is a breathtaking segment that will never be topped by any other animation studio in this millennium or the next. I cannot recommend this work of genius enough. If you find anything whatsoever to dislike about it, I suggest seeking professional help immediately. Otherwise, pop this into your video or DVD player, put your feet up and watch this piece of animated history unfold before your very eyes. 10/10",1.0
5540,"Boring, horribly dated; I watched this as part of my World Cultures class in 7th grade a few years back.  I hated it then, I hated it now. Now I'm not going to criticize the stop motion effects (and superimposition) just for being stop motion effects.  Some of them (Medusa, the Kraken) were effective to a degree, others (the little metal owl, the talking statue) were just pathetic.  The superimposition was used better than in most other movies that that technique had been used in.  The other effects, like the flood sequence for instance, were just dated, no other word for it. The acting is something I have issue with.  Harry Hamlin IMO is at best a mediocre actor, and certainly doesn't have the charisma or the talent to carry a film on his own.  Burgess Meredith didn't have a whole lot to do that's worth remembering.  Laurence Olivier as Zeus - well, as Gilbert Gottfried said on ""I Love The '80s"", by this time in his career Olivier had given up any pretext of being a good actor, and though he gives as a good performance as anyone probably could've mustered out of this material, in this film he falls into the sad category with Henry Fonda, Orson Welles, and Marlon Brando, of the once-great actor appearing as a figurehead-type authority figure, and getting top billing for ten minutes of screen time.  None of the other cast members are particularly memorable either. The storyline isn't too bad, but it's just executed rather poorly.  The writing is frankly horrible for the most part.  Direction is adequate, but the film's set pieces (except the scene where Perseus faces off with Medusa) are lacking in any tension or excitement, which is a tragedy.  Jerry Goldsmith's score is good but not one of his best. Obviously ""Clash of the Titans"" was made for eight year old kids to waste a few hours at, so maybe I'm not in a position to comment on this film.  But I just find ""Clash of the Titans"" boring - I can't put my finger on exactly why. Four stars out of ten.",0.0

3751,"It's clucking MAD FUN!; Chicken Run (2000, Dir. Peter Lord, Nick Park) Story Aardman's first full theatrical stop motion film shows Ginger, Bunty, Babs and Fowler are chickens who are trapped on their farm and desperately want to escape. If they don't produce any eggs for the week, Mr and Mrs Tweedy will have their heads. After every attempt, they fail and their time is running out. When it seems like all their attempts have failed, an American rooster called Rocky falls into the farm. Seeing Rocky flying, Ginger now realises that the only way out now, is by flying. The chickens must learn the trade of flying before time runs outs. Actors The problem with movies using stop motion animation is that you don't actually see the actors, and instead must hear their voices. The cast chosen to provide the voices in this film have been chosen carefully in order for them to all suit their character. Benjamin Whitrow provides the perfect voice for Fowler. Timothy Spall and Phil Daniels make a wonderful comic team with the voices matching to the characters of Nick and Fetcher. Mel Gibson is also a nice addition as Rocky. The character really does feel as if he's a rooster from America. Mel is not a complete unknown actor and isn't too famous to distract you from the character. The only problem with the voices I have is Julia Sawalha. To me her voice just sounds awkward when blended in with the other characters. You could possibly say it is too English. This is only my opinion and may someone else might feel different about her 'thick' accent. Music The score in this film is actually very good. Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell give you a soundtrack which isn't a blatant rip-off of 'The Great Escape' but also has the same feeling to it. There are some good tunes hears and really fits in well with what is happening on screen. An animation film is harder to build up excitement than a live action film, and 'Chicken Run' is able to accomplish this by the use of the music. The music really builds up tension, especially in the scene, when the chicken are trying to fly off in their 'home-made' plane. Special Effects The only special effects I can really refer to is the animation techniques. Like all other popular Aardman material, the characters in the film are made with a kind of plasticine kind of material. Even today, there characters still look wonderful to watch and enjoy. It never puts the viewer off by what they are. It seems as anything is possible with these characters, as they moveÂ…and fly just like real people. All the buildings look amazing. So many different camera angles are used, that they do actually look as if they are real full-size sets. Conclusion Chicken Run, like all other Aardman movies, is a remarkable film. Not as memorable as the Wallace & Gromit series, but still a fun 'chick' flick. It's suitable for the whole family and contains jokes for the whole family to understand. It's not too short and not too long, and includes a story easily understandable by younger viewers. This is a perfect film to watch together on a wet weekend. ""I don't want to be a pie. I don't like gravy."" Â– Babs (Jane Horrocks)",0.875
66097,"Kudos To Henry Sellick; Henry Sellick is one gem of an animator to be reckoned with. His contribution to stop motion animation is superb. I had my world rocked big time with 'Nightmare Before Christmas',as well as 'James And The Giant Peach'. Sellick mines the harbor of author Neil Gaiman (American Gods)with the story of Coraline, a feisty 11 year-old girl (voiced by Dakota Fanning)who is very unhappy with the fact that she's been moved from her original home (as well as her best friends),to live in a creepy old house, with some pretty weird neighbors. When Coraline finds a portal into a alternate dimension with parents who seem like the ideal parents,Coraline seriously decides to cross over to that realm,for good. Somehow, something seems...well...not quite right. The film gets some good mileage from the other voice talents on parade here (including Terri Hatcher as both her Mothers). This lovingly stop motion animated feature film is available in both 3-D digital projection, as well as standard 2-D,for the benefit of cinemas that do not have the set ups for 3-D,digital projection (if you have the open window of opportunity to see the 3-D edition,by all means,do it--although the 2-D animated prints would be just as much fun). Handed a PG rating by the MPAA,this film serves up some situations that are pretty creepy & scary for the little ones (much like 'Nightmare Before Christmas'was).

First off, I'm a huge fan of Tim Burton and there's been very few things that Tim Burton was some part in that I didn't like. What was done with the movie nice was craftsmanship, such a small crew come together to make this film and it is wonderful. The voices performed by the cast fit their characters so well, the graphics were beyond amazing, and for the largest part of all expectations this movie is top notch. Now I've saw many reviews that has been giving this film some bad press and honestly I'm not sure what their gripe is given that the largest portion of the people posting the negative reviews enjoyed ""The Expendables""; I guess that answers our questions on that. 9 was simply amazing, I have it in my movie collection and have watched it more than 50 times over; I've enjoyed every moment of it. Simply a beautiful concept in a film.",0.0
2302,"Not deep but perfect; Have just finished watching this for about the 10th time in as many years. It never fails to delight and each viewing reveals a new small perfect detail. Lack of energy in the acting by the two 'criminals' makes them non-entities, which is OK, because everyone else is perfect and the movie clicks like a well-oiled machine. Marisa Tomei wears her part as perfectly as she does her outrageous New York outfits, and this tends to obscure what a great job the other major actors and director have done in polishing this gem. See it when you want to walk away feeling really good. One caution: your 'street language tolerance' must be at least medium, although the language used by all the characters (from street to stately) is an essential part of the film's flavor.",0.0
66097,"Breaking Through to the Other Side; I'm angry at Henry Selick. He hasn't directed a good stop motion film since James and the Giant Peach which was thirteen years ago. He's finally returned to form and produced a soon-to-be cult classic much like The Nightmare Before Christmas. Like his signature film, Coraline will find audience outside its target. Do not take your young children to see this movie. It will either frighten them or perplex them. It is like the best psychological horror films in its ability to create innate tension through droll environments. It doesn't sound novel on paper, and it isn't. Coraline is a dark fantasy story brought to life (or death) through 3D technology. It's also one of the first non-Pixar movies I've watched that doesn't treat 3D as a gimmick. I've not read much of Neil Gaiman's, but I've seen many movies adapted from his work. Many of them contain an Alice in Wonderland story, in which a character discovers another world. Stardust and Coraline are both in this vein. I found the former to be inappropriately silly. Whatever the main guy's name is doesn't seem affected by his otherworldly discovery. Coraline is sinister, and therefore the preferred approach. The other world is a dangerous, inhospitable place. The heroine is adolescent Coraline Jones, whose parents have recently relocated to a desolate apartment in nowheresville. They spend all of their time working in poorly-lighted rooms. There is only one other child Coraline's age and she doesn't like him. Wybie, the other child, tells Coraline that many children have gone missing in the apartment. She doesn't believe him, of course. So she pokes around the house until she discovers a strange door. Inside is a Candy Land world where everything she desires is present. Her ""other"" parents are expressive and loving. They lack human eyes, instead sporting buttons, which do not affect their ability to see. Coraline begins visiting frequently until the Other Mother asks her if she would like to stay permanently. Other Mother is revealed to be an ageless enigma, preying on the unhappiness of children. The children are kept forever in a purgatory state, unless they can find their human eyes. Coraline escapes back to the first world to discover that her parents are missing. She must return to Other World and rescue them, along with the eyes of Mother's other victims. She wants to set them free. It's a cheap storyline device that forces the story forward to its scary conclusion. The story falls flat once the other world is discovered, so a new evil is invented. The last segment has a video game quality to it. Watching Coraline collect various items, while using an object to discern the true nature of the other world reminded me of a similar plotting element from The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. Coraline isn't your average Bolt-like children's movie. It's frightening and unsettling. I even jumped out of my seat a few times, dare I admit. Selick's art design may be similar to Tim Burton's but nothing more. The film's pallet is dark until the very end. Think about the opening shots of Wall-E. No uplifting songs or sympathy with characters are present in Coraline. She's a disagreeable child who doesn't try to be lovable. She really needs a spanking. Coraline reminds me of her parents, in her callous disregard for other people. She isn't burdened with responsibility yet, so she's just unsociable. I can see her writing at the kitchen table for whatever reason like her mother does. Some movies, not this one, are made to be viewed in 3D. If it isn't worth the ticket price, then have no qualms about watching it in 2D. Selick uses 3D to emphasize certain objects before Coraline approaches them. Remove all thoughts of My Bloody Valentine 3D from your head. The story is capable of scaring you without resulting to desperate pickaxe-in-your-face shots. Selick has stated that the movie is for ""brave children of all ages."" I'd have to disagree with him. Coraline is a film for adults of all ages and some of their children. The drab set design, Other Mother's skeletal figure, and various cinematic elements will not appeal to youngsters. It's similar to Monster House. I'd love to see Selick adapt an adult Neil Gaiman novel or something else intended for an older audience. Horror anime has been available for years, yet the West has produced no suitable substitute. With a film like Coraline, we are beginning to fill that gap. This is the first great movie of 2009 and a Best Animated Picture candidate. Leave the kids at home when you go see it.",0.0
3751,"The latest dazzling animation to support a weak story; Being a fan of animated features, I went to Chicken Run full of anticipation, what with all the positive reviews and the high esteem bestowed upon the film's creators (whose Wallace and Gromit shorts I've never seen). But instead of a charming, witty, light-hearted fable, I got a leaden, trite, obvious trifle.  It doesn't take 10 seconds of heavy-booted footsteps to figure out a character is evil, but that's how this story is told.  And someone should advise the scriptwriters that a joke you can guess in advance (""beautiful chicks"") is not funny. Sure, the animation is amazing.  A lot of animated features these days are visually amazing.  But a good animated film needs a good story with characters you care about to make all that painstaking effort worthwhile.

6493,"cute, a little funny, and predictable; This movie was by no means great, but it wasn't that bad.  It's about a writer who must finish his novel in 30 days to pay off the Cuban mafia. So, he meets Emma who will type the novel up. Then a lot of the film has Wilson and Hudson playing the novel characters and that's where we get some laughs. What I really didn't like was of course, at the end, the 2 declare their love? What! All they did was sit around an apartment and write a book and one time it shows them going out to walk around the city, and that means they fall in love.  It was a very weak attempt at romance. The problem arises when another lady from Alex's life shows up and she just happened to be the lady he was using for his novel so Emma gets mad? Alex and Emma weren't even dating.  The whole romance part was just lame, but I enjoying the scenes with the characters from the novel.

6773,"Clever comedy and just plain fun to watch; I went to go see this film having heard nothing about it before  buying my ticket. That said, I can't speak to whether it lives up to any particular hype, but I thoroughly enjoyed it throughout. More than anything, I was impressed by how clearly this story was told using almost nothing but visuals. This might not sound like a big deal, but it really is...there's a very nice balance struck here, in that the viewer is intrigued by plot points that have yet to be explained but not confused by tons of hanging threads. This kind of tension is hard to maintain when one has the luxury of dialogue, so achieving it with a more or less non-verbal film is quite cool. Finally, I say ""clever"" comedy since this is a very nice example of a film that feels complete because almost everything we see onscreen becomes a small part of the larger story structure. Very little gets thrown away in this film, and the closer you watch, the more you notice how many small details were left for the viewer to find by him or herself. That kind of care makes a movie like this a treasure hunt for the audience, and as such, I would highly recommend it. Is it European? Yes. Is it different? Yes. Is it the sign of a new wave of animation which will turn the world on it's ear? I doubt it. But it's well done start-to-finish, and that alone makes it worth checking out.",0.027777777777777776
2302,"Great Modern Comedy; WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD This is one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen - it plays as a court drama with some police investigation in between, but in the end it's just a great parody of all those serious court drama sub-genre. The plot is as straightforward as possible, and what's special in this movie is the dialogue and the character relationships - Pesci's Vinny and Tomei's Mona are a great foul-mouthed, wise-mouthed couple that are in a constant battle of wits. The actor who plays the judge - and I remember him from The Cotton Club - also steals many scenes for his funny performance as a no-nonsense judge whom you'd think almost has a personal grudge over Vincent, the way they never get along. There are all sorts of jokes here - visual jokes like when Vinny shows up in court with a ridiculous suit; court procedure jokes like Vinny doesn't know he's allowed to see the case files until Mona points that out, fish-out-water jokes because Vinny isn't used to the country life, great misunderstandings like when Vinny visits the defendants in prison and one thinks he's there to rape them, and just great witty dialogues.

When this was released back in 1979 this film upset many liberal religious freaks because they thought it was about the story of Christ when any fan of this film will tell you it is about Brian and not Christ. The problem being that most people who let their life be ruled by religion are so narrow minded that they never bothered to watch the film but just judged it anyway......Morons. Some of the one liners and Sketches in the movie are some of the most memorable in cinematic history and repeated by Python fans throughout the world and quite rightly so.

71057,"Gorgeous, but story could be better; 9 is a strange film. Originally a short film created by Shane Acker for his thesis in computer animation, Tim Burton caught wind of it and decided to produce a full-length feature based on the short. I genuinely enjoyed it for its moody visuals and themes, which earned it its PG-13 rating, but at the same time felt it failed to live up to its full potential. At its heart, 9 is a mix of sci-fi ideas we've seen many times before: it's part Terminator, part Matrix, and even part Lord of the Rings Â– which leads to many clichÃ©s. The movie takes place in an alternate reality in which a fascist country echoing Nazi Germany seizes control of a brilliant scientist's A.I. creation simply called ""The Machine"", which promptly turns against the humans. What little we see of humanity takes place in newsreel flashbacks and their lifeless remains. As the war machines take over the world, the scientist manages to create a series of small robots in his lab to continue the spirit of mankind. The film opens as his 9th and final creation boots up completely unaware of who or what it is, or what has happened to the world. I'll have to venture into spoiler territory to lay out the issues I had with it, so if you haven't seen the film I'd advise you to watch it first. One of 9â€²s best ideas is that the scientist gifted each of his robot creations a piece of his own soul. This explains the archetypal nature of the heroes and where their sentience comes from. Unfortunately, 9 accidentally reawakens The Machine, which feeds on this energy, and is intelligent enough to fabricate robot minions that are more compelling than itself, which is basically just a big monster with a glowing red eye. The film falters when, rather than seeing the heroes combine their creative spirit and intelligence to fight The Machine by inventing mechanical tools, we are left with a series of hand-to-hand fight scenes involving mainly makeshift melee weapons. These are action-packed and fun to watch, but don't make good use of the film's underlying premise. Near the beginning of the film, 9 creates a torch from an old light bulb and battery. I would have liked to see the heroes put their heads together to come up with more interesting solutions like this in the spur of the moment to reflect their creator's inventive spirit, particularly as they band together to finally end the menace of The Machine. The best ideas seem to get lost amidst the action scenes. 9 soon runs afoul of the de facto leader of the group, who has taken a neo-Luddite stance in regards to science and wears makeshift religious attire. He and some of the others have taken refuge in what appears to be the shell of Notre Dame cathedral and forbids 9 from venturing too far afield. This undertone of science vs religion, introduced so early in the film, is quickly abandoned when it could have played a much more pivotal role. The film also ends on a false spiritual note when, having reclaimed the souls of the lost members of the group, they are released to the heavens instead of (as I think most people will be expecting) they could have been returned to their bodies and been brought back to life. While that would have been perhaps a bit too easy and happy for this film, I think it makes more sense than what finally happens. While this review might seem largely negative, let me reaffirm that it is an enjoyable and visually stunning action movie. Shane Acker proves he can direct frenetic action scenes that will have you riveted to your seat. His willingness to venture into dark and often frightening territory is a welcome change of pace compared to the vast majority of Western animated films and Tim Burton was right to open the door for his directorial debut. It's just too bad that 9 isn't the 9 out of 10 it could have been. And I do look forward to seeing what this new young director comes up with next.",0.0

It's also a good story, that appeals to both adults and children. Is it the best of the 'Wallace and Gromit' films? Probably not.

5540,"Not Ray Harryhausen's Best Work; The story of CLASH OF THE TITANS isn't very good. But most people who want to see it probably won't care anyway. I know I didn't. They probably want to watch the movie because it was the last movie Ray Harryhausen worked on. However, the special effects aren't very good either. I don't know much about stop-motion special effects but I don't think this is really his best work. JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, ONE MILLION YEARS B.C., and Harryhausen's SINBAD movies all have better effects. Just watch the battle between the triceratops and the ceratosaurus in ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. or the skeleton fight in JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS. The only part of CLASH OF THE TITANS that I thought matched these sequences was the scene with Medusa. And I must say that they just build up Medusa too much. She's awesome but the one of the Stygian Witches says something like ""She's more dangerous than a hundred krakens"" or something like that. Yeah, that's a bit of an exaggeration. And I guess I should write a little about the story. It's pretty bad. I don't mind that they put a kraken in a story that is supposed to be based on Greek mythology. I don't really mind any mythological inaccuracies. What I do mind is that it's unoriginal. You can talk about the ""Hero's Journey"" all you want but just because a lot of quest stories follow a certain pattern, it doesn't mean that writers can't try to be a bit original. A lot of people have already mentioned similarities to STAR WARS IV. There are just too many for CLASH OF THE TITANS to be really fun.",0.0

It's hard to tell which character's story this is.There are a trio swing group,a grandmother,and a grandson,and also their dog.By examining each character you can see different points of view,new aspects of the movie.It's even true for the dog.The story is so simple but the beauty lies in details.Like the evolution of the train passing by the house or the thin bodies of the triples who eating frogs as everyone around is fat due to eating burgers. The screenplay doesn't just put the situation in front of the the watcher as it is.It builds a background,tells how things started,shows where they happen.So we know where we are from and where we are going.And we easily accept the world things happening.Because doesn't try to judge it,just it as it is and leave the decision to us.Besides it's not that different from our world.But I think it doesn't really take any risk,I mean it just shows the sides it wants.We can't totally describe the whole place.But it gives the wave of atmosphere as we all know Bellivelle. And there's something to be said about animations.The style is not that kind we're used to.And it really can put the audience off the movie.As the Japan animation and their style with sharp lines get the favor of most of us,it's a real bet to think this can work in most of Europe and U.S.A..And I should say that there's nearly no speech.But animations are so successful about telling the story that you can think that if there were words,they would be burdens.There isn't a clear and clean vision,and it has some kind of dark side.But after all these the total of the elements;story,details,music,make you think like that's the only way to do this one.That was what I mean when I said it's not in totally European way.Maybe not using a specific.well-known way but telling what it has in mind clearly;from story to details. The music is really interesting.Because of the fact that the triples are swing singers,you may hope beautiful songs.But these are more than that.I can't definitely claim that the songs are awesome but they are really intersting.Lyrics,enstruments...nothimg familiar to MTV generation.I don't think the song that got a nomination for Oscars deserved it but it sure deserves some attention. This animation movie has one thing in common with Japan animation style:It's not for kids.Maybe it seems sweet,funny but details like killing the frogs with dynamites... I don't think Chomet designed this for kids.Except children I don't think Bellivelle will hurt anyone in mind.Of course it seems as a strange way to make this kind of animation for big guys,but I bet it would be stranger if this was a real movie. I can't suggest this movie to everyone.It dances in a thin line.There  are a lot of fans of this movie out there.As a fan of American story-telling style.I only can say that I liked it.I'm not a fan,I can't even say that I may watch it again.But at least the attention to get into this movie will identify if you're a movie fan or just a watcher.I can't say this for every movie,especially for an European movie,but Belleville deserves it.",0.027777777777777776

19,"There's Been A Kidnapping of a Sacred African Bat And Ace is on the Case!; CONTAINS SPOILERS High in the Alps is a rescue mission to save a stranded raccoon. Many of the team members have given up the search, except for one: Ace Ventura, Pet Detective! He soon finds the raccoon on the mountain across from his. He climbs across to it, straps the raccoon to him and starts back when suddenly the strap breaks and the poor raccoon falls to his death. Ace was devastated. A man, Fulton Greenwall, was seeking out Ace Ventura. He found him living in a Buddhist monk temple. He came to them a broken man and had finally found inner peace. Greenwall explained the situation so Ace: a sacred animal of the African Wachati tribe had been stolen. Ace said he could not leave the temple, however there was $20,000 in it for him and plus the monks encourage him to go. They throw a giant party when he leaves. While on the plane to Africa, Greenwall explains the entire story: the Wachati princess is set to wed, however the rival Wachootoo tribe is against this and unless the sacred animal is returned within four days, the tribes go to war. Ace wasn't paying attention as Greenwall spoke. They soon arrive in Africa and in a Jeep driven by Ace, they head to the consulate. Ace takes a bulky short cut, but they soon tumble to their destination. Once at the consulate, Ace meets Vincent Cadby and Burton Quinn who had a raven, Tinky, on his shoulders. Ace mingles with folks but ends up making a fool out of himself. He and Greenwall then travel to the Wachati village. Along the way, Ace finally learns what sacred animal he was chasing after: a Great White bat. The bat was the only animal which Ace detested, but he wouldn't give up his case. When Ace meets the chief, he learns that launching loogies is a show of affection. That evening, Ace attends a seductive dance the Wachati princess performs, even though she is spoken for. While the tribe and Greenwall dance, Ace investigates the sacred hut and finds a black feather beneath the cage. The princess and Ace chat. She says she wasn't really looking forward to her wedding.  Well, the next day, Ace reluctantly investigates a bat cave and finds another black feather so he suspects Quinn. He spies on him inside a mechanical rhino, but what Ace didn't count on is that it can get pretty hot in one of those things and the door wouldn't open. Ace soon finds a most unpleasant way out. He then interrogates Quinn who turns  out innocent. When Ace explores the jungles, he's hit with several poison darts from the Wachootoo tribe so he sneaks into their village. He's caught. They tell him that he must pass several Wachootoo tests to live. He passes all but one: pit of death. His opponent was a tough one. But since Ace's fighting made the tribe laugh, they didn't kill him.             Ace next stumbles upon a group of poachers: Mick Katie and Gahjii who had the Great White bat in their posession! They capture Ace and tie him to a raft on the river that goes down a waterfall. When Ace surfaces, he wrestles a crocodile. When returning to the Wachati village, Ace was confused. What was it the kidnappers were after? And then it hit him: Guano, (bat droppings). Ace returns the consulate. Mick and Gahjii were just handing the bat to Cadby when Ace burst in and solved the case right then and there. Ace then calls on his jungle animal friends and soon heards of elephants, lions, zebras, antilope, etc. come crashing in. Ace takes care of Mick and Gahjii with a skunk. Cadby escapes but Ace gives chase in a big-foot truck. By then, the Wachati and the Wachootoo tribes were getting ready for battle. That's when Ace successfully grabbed the bat and returned it to the sacred hut. Cadby escaped into the jungle but was soon caught by a silver-back gorilla, and it was mating season! Soon the wedding of the Wachati princess was on, only they made the detection that she was no longer a virgin. Suddenly Ace found himself being chased into the jungle by both tribes. Well, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls wasn't really as good as the first. The first was much better. Jim Carrey reprises his role as the world's craziest animal detective. I wonder if there will ever be an Ace Ventura III. I doubt it. It seems as if Jim Carrey is getting more and more into serious films, but fear not, Carrey fans, I hear Jim will be making a return to comedy this spring in Bruce Almighty. Until then, we can enjoy his other physical comedy films, such as Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls. Not as good as the original and is packed with crude humor but Ace Ventura fans as well as Jim Carrey fans, it comes recommended by me! -",0.0
50005,"On a technical standpoint it's definitely Zhang Yimou's best; As someone who is slowly becoming a big fan of Zhang Yimou's work I decided I might give this a try. Out of the movies I have seen that he's done of Hero, House Of Flying Daggers and this that this is by far the weakest of his movies, which is not to say that I didn't like it - I just preferred Flying Daggers and Hero more. Even on it's own I'd say it is worth a watch. The main focus is this Borgia-type family of the Chinese Emperor trying to seize more power. The Emperor is poisoning his wife - slowly but surely, his first born wants to make his mother happy, the Empress finds out about the poisoning and wants to confront the Emperor about it and stop him from continuing by any means necessary, The Emperor's second born is in a love relationship with a slave girl who's a part of a family that's secretly trying to kill the Emperor and also trying to stop an... incestuous relationship with the Empress and the third born barely knows anything about what's going on. So what's good about this movie. Well as typical of Yimou's work the cinematography is excellent, The fight scenes are very impressive and as typical of Hero, the scale of everything is just huge. I'm not kidding when I say that I think Yimou took the best technical elements of both Hero and House of Flying Daggers and combined both of them to make a technical marvel. I think especially in the battle scenes in the last third... It looks like something out of Hollywood (actually I may go so far as to say it looks better). On a non-technical standpoint, the story maybe where it falls flat. The first third is completely uninteresting unless you love looking at art design and the characters... This may seem obvious but they aren't that likable and even then they aren't that interesting. On a more positive note about the story, I liked Chow Yun Fat's performance as The Emperor. Basically he comes across as the guy who seems reasonable unless you do something to upset him, when that happens - run, but when I put it like that you might expect him to play it basically like a whiny spoiled brat, but he doesn't. All I have to say is that I do want to see more of his movies. So I just preferred House of Flying Daggers and Hero more. But if you are looking for a movie about diabolical family trying to double-cross and back-stab each other then this is probably going to be a major fill for you. This does have some really good things going for it, like that cinematography, I could talk about how this movie looks good for hours. If you want to watch this then I'd say it is definitely worth a look.",0.0
5540,"Ppl in the science fiction n fantasy movies owe a lot to the genius Harryhausen. Learnt a lot about Greek mythology characters thru this.; I saw this on a VHS in the mid 80s. I really enjoyed this. Bought a VHS in the late 80s, then a vcd in late 90s. Revisited it recently on a DVD. It is a nicely paced movie and the scenery is breathtaking. This movie is great fun. The credit for this goes to the wonderful stop-animation work of Ray Harryhausen. This is the last and finest example of his work. The best thing in this film was the showdown with Medusa. The scene is dark, creepy, and intense. I have re-watched the movie so many times and I still find it to be a great mythological fantasy film. The film has Kraken a giant monster, Calibos the satyr, blind witches, the devil's boatman, Cerberus - depicted with two heads instead of the usual three, mechanical owl, giant scorpions and finally Medusa, as a memorably striking n frightening creature. It also has Burgess Meredith (Rocky's trainer). Some beautiful cinematography by Ted Moore (7 James bond films, the golden voyage of sindbad, sindbad and the eye of the tiger). The karst area in El Torcal de Antequera, Spain appears in the visit to the Stygian witches. The Azure Window in Gozo, Malta, appears in the battle against the Kraken. I made my kids watch this few years before the remake. We all saw the remake in theatre n we all were disappointed. My kids were enquiring where is Burgess Meredith's character in the remake?",0.0
3751,"It's an ingenious little adventure;  The creators of the British animated classic `Wallace and Gromit' bring their magic to a full length feature. It's an ingenious little adventure that follows the hopes and dreams of a chicken named Ginger (Julia Sawalha). Her dream is to escape Mrs. Tweedy's chicken farm. She claims she can do it on her own but what bewilders her is that she is afraid for all her fellow fowl within the coop. So their plan focuses upon all of them in one huge jail-break. Ginger's prayers seem to be answered when a `flying' rooster named Rocky (Mel Gibson) drops into the coop after escaping a traveling circus. Meanwhile Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson) develops a plan to turn her little farm into a massive `chicken pot pie' factory forcing Ginger and Rocky to teach all the others to fly before they become pies. What makes `Chicken Run' so ingenious was how the animators made us want to be apart of the chicken world. We fall head over heals involved with these chickens and their daily lives. Coupled with that involvement, `Chicken Run' also cleverly delivers us into a `prison breakout' movie filled with humor, and excitement. `Chicken Run' is a pure delight. For many people this will be their first experimentation with a full length animated feature involving clay. The clay for me helps reflect the tones and dimensions of the characters. In some ways I think it aids a lot in the audience's involvement in the chicken world. Placing aside the claymation and those magnificent machines, `Chicken Run' also brings back a lot of classic Hollywood moments in the films setting. There are scenes which remind us a lot of the classic World War 2 prison movies. Films like the `Great Escape', `Stalag 17' and even the misadventures of `Hogan's Heroes'. What I liked about those film references here is that they weren't here to poke fun at the films but to play homage. The references also aid the audience in diving deeper into the film and its delight. If you remember `Wallace and Gromit' then you may recall all their huge machines which helped enchant their everyday lives. From the rocket-ship to the sheep shearing machine, `Chicken Run' has these kinds of machines which have always amazed me in their transformation and assembly. How do they dream up these wondrous machines? (4.5 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer. (Opens June 23rd)",0.875
71057,"just OK but animation gets a 10 so overall its good.; ""9"" is a digitally animated film that was released in 2009 starring Elijah Wood. So what to say about 9. Did I love it, well no. Did I hate it, well no. So is this movie ""good"" well yes. It is not for everyone and the story is just O.K. However, this movie is beautifully animated and well acted. The tale takes place in a future where machines once made to serve us and fight our wars have turned on us and destroyed the world and killed all humans. Wait no this is not a review of the Matrix or of the terminator, which is one of the things that make this movie just o.k. The evil creature that is at the heart of all destruction is even reminiscent of something from the ""matrix"". So why watch this movie well unless you are a stoner or a sci-fi geek you can probably skip this one, but if you are either or both you may have a good time.

66097,"Dazzling, Frightening, And A Truly Amazing Film; Coraline is a stop motion animated movie based off the novel by the genius author, Neil Gaiman. Directed by Henry Selick(Nightmare Before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach) Coraline expands the story from the original book and makes it into it's own glorious movie. Coraline Jones has just moved into a new house called the Pink Palace. The house is split into three ways; the main house, the attic, and the cellar. Coraline shares the house with her strange neighbors Mr. Bobinsky who is training a group of mice for a circus, and Ms. Spink and Forcible who were once great theater stars. Coraline's parents are making a catalog for a botanical magazine and are much too busy to satisfy Coraline's boredom. She befriends a neighbor boy, Whyborn(Whybie) Lovat whose grandmother owns the Pink Palace. One night Coraline is awoken from her sleep by a mouse and is lured to a mysterious tiny door in the wall of her living room. Using a button shaped key, she opens the door and goes through a tunnel to a parallel world of her own. There she meets The Other Mother who looks the same as her regular mom but with buttons for eyes. The Other Mother makes fantastic food, and shows Coraline many wonderful things. Such as an actual mice circus from the Other Bobinsky, a show by the Other Ms. Forcible and Spink, and a magnificent garden tended by her Other Father. But everything is not as it seems. Coraline soon realizes the only way to stay in that world is to let the Other Mother sew buttons into her eyes. Soon Coraline discovers the true intent of the Other Mother and the once wonderful world becomes distorted and terrifying. Coraline needs to escape from The Other Mother and get back home to her real parents. If they're even still there. Coraline is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. It's dark and beautiful style amazes me every time. This whole thing was done by hand for many years and you can tell everyone put their heart and soul into it. The voice acting is also great. Dakota Fanning gives Coraline a spunky personality, and Teri Hatcher's voice performance made The Other Mother all the more horrifying. The rest of the cast is great as well with actors like John Hodgman, Ian McShane, Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French, and Keith David bringing life into their respective characters. If you get the chance you should buy the 3D version. Unlike most films the 3D version was made before 3D TV's were available to the public and instead comes with regular red and blue 3D glasses. This makes the visuals feel a little weird at first but the 3D is some of the best I've seen. Overall, you owe it to yourself to watch Coraline. Either buy it from your local store or rent it from somewhere. It's an experience you will not soon forget.",0.0
6101,"Frustrating, depressing but unforgettable.; Whatever happened during the Allende regime and The Coup De Etat in Chile in the early 70's is open for conjecture in regards to US involvement. I saw 'Missing' in it's initial release back in 82' at the age of 14 and it was a bit over my head. Having watched it again made me question my beliefs and overall ethos of political views. This story, which is adapted from a true story, is intended to assign blame directly at the political powers that be. Whether you are right or left winged in your political stances, you should definitely be concerned about what can possibly happen if you think that being an 'American' automatically protects you from harm by default. What really makes this movie memorable is not so much the political story, because it happens to be very confusing. We are caught in a mishmash of conspiracy theories, paranoia and bureaucratic floundering. If you try to analyze the politics and make sense as the story progresses you will only get more confused and bewildered. Politics is a dirty game where duplicity is prevalent. The average Joe who falls victim will have to bite the dust and be labelled as an anonymous sack who ran in the wrong place at the wrong time. In Charles Horman's case, his quixotic curiosity killed him. What we do know in retrospect is that on one night in September 1973, 50,000 people were rounded up of which 750 were executed. Charles Horman and several other Americans where among them. Historical records are certain that the US was complicit in aiding the Coup effort, but whether they ordered a kill operation intentionally is debatable. Perhaps even implausible. Jack Lemmon is chosen for a role, in utmost poignancy, to be the concerned and frustrated father. Jack Lemmon, who was typically known for more comedic roles, gets another rare shot at flexing his acting chops and he does so with gleaming success. Sissy Spacek does an admirable job at shadowing Lemmon's character with correct composure. The story of these two, father in law - daughter in law, takes precedence while Charles character seems like an afterthought at best. The drama of Ed and beth is what really ignites this film and their personal and harrowing journey of finding Charles. There are two particularly touching and moving scenes between them that i will not mention. I have tried to picture other actors to fit those roles to see if they could have been better cast. I think Jack Lemmon was an absolutely perfect choice. There are a couple of random characters such as Janice Rule and Babcock, whose roles seem rather superfluous to the story. Perhaps they were there to fill up the screen time or help the continuity of the film.But some of these characters just added more unnecessary confusion. I even wonder why 'Missing' was ever made. It could have just easily been a segment on '60 Minutes', but it is stretched out in a 122 minute feature length film.",0.0

Unfortunately, pending on age, this one, the sequel, is the weaker of the two. Despite a scene where Ace is, ahem, grooming his gopher, most of this movie is pointed toward the kids of the audience (lots of ""Aren't the animals cute?"" humor). However, there are a few scenes adults can get a hearty laugh at, like Ace's well-timed ""Twilight Zone"" and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang references. Being a Jim Carrey vehicle, the movie's also pretty quotable (""Excuse me, your ba1l$ are showing! - Bumblebee-tuna."") My favorite scene, of course, is Ace's escape from an undercover robo-rhino much to the dismay of a family on safari.",0.0
71057,9 film review; I loved this movie it was a great mix of action horror and the effects were awesome. The movie is a great experience for any age group. Many people say that it didn't get deep enough into the characters such as 3 and 4 or 6 also 8 didn't get much screen time although he is mainly comic relief. 6 was my favourite and I would consider him the most innocent of the stitch punks. In this film I felt that when each doll died it was supposed to mean something different instead of just having it like oh another ones dead lets move along. Well anyway I all around felt this movie was good enough to compete with some of those big blockbusters of 2009.,0.0
1080,"Life of Brian: 7/10; `The film so funny it was banned in Norway!' Life of Brian has been penned with that phrase in Sweden, because it was, because Norway believed it to be blasphemous. In an interview, they said that they didn't really consider it to be blasphemous, and I don't either. It's just funny, plain and simple. Brian is a baby born on the original Christmas. First, the three Wise Men accidentally go into his house, instead of Jesus'. Fast forward to the year 33 A.D., where Brian (Graham Chapman) is a regular Jew, who hates the Romans who take over and lives with his overbearing mother (Terry Jones). He falls into the hands of the People's Front of Judea and is fighting against the Romans. Soon he becomes mistaken for the Messiah. Well, at least it has more of a plot than The Meaning of Life. Better than Meaning of Life, not as funny as Holy Grail. During the first two thirds of the movie, the laughs came steadily. During the last part of the film, the laughs teetered off a little. And, since most of the plot is about Brian being mistaken for the Messiah, it came surprisingly late in the film, maybe around halfway. Of course, it couldn't be considered a Monty Python film if it didn't have the trademark animation. The opening credits (which also sported a better song than Meaning of Life) had kooky animation, as with the animation/claymation halfway through, where Brian gets `rescued' by a spaceship. Being a Latin student myself, I cracked up when Brian was writing graffiti and was corrected by a soldier about his grammar. I could actually understand what they were talking about! Something else that made me laugh out loud was when Brian went to buy something but was hounded to haggle. There were other funny scenes, and most of the movie was hit instead of missÂ…though a couple points didn't strike me as funny. During the interview I mentioned earlier, they ended by singing `Always Look on the Bright Side of Life', and I didn't know that it came from this movie. It was a humorous ending to the movie. Of course, all of the Monty Pythoners were in top condition, not showing any signs of weakness yet. I particularly like John Cleese and Eric Idle the most, with Idle seeming to come off best. The six main actors altogether had 40 parts! Beat that, Eddie Murphy! Other `regulars', such as Carol Cleveland and Neil Innes, did well also. Not the best, not the worst of the Monty Python movies, but Life of Brian isn't one to be missed. My rating: 7/10 Rated R for nudity, religious themes, and language.",0.0

Even all the side characters are brilliantly played. This movie never grabbed the public's attention the way it should have, likely because there are no big names featured here. I can watch this film over and over again. Everything about this film could make anyone laugh. My rating: 7/10.",0.0
38038,"charming characters, snappy animation, but a bit too long; The first full-length film featuring the Aardman characters Wallace and Gromit manages to bring in elements of all the previous half-hour show which aired on television. Wallace runs a company to humanely capture rogue rabbits from people's vegetable gardens, and has the bright idea to try out his invention on the hapless bunnies once they're caught. Of course, as in other Wallace and Gromit films, things don't quite work out as planned. Similarly to A Close Shave, there's a love interest for Wallace, in this case the village Lady Posh, and a big mean villain with a bullish dog. Gromit is beautifully animated with a wide range of expressions making the character laugh out loud funny. And of course Peter Sallis provides the voice of Wallace again and is a perfect fit. And as in A Grand Day Out, cheese features heavily to great comedic effect as the film moves along. On the negative side this film is a little on the long side. There are great effects, and some pieces which make you sit up and watch, but perhaps this story would have worked better as another short subject rather than pushing it to feature-length.",1.0

4326,"Hackman and Dafoe shine alongside McDormand; ""Hatred isn't something you're born with. It gets taught... At 7 years of age, you get told it enough times, you believe it. You believe the hatred. You live it... you breathe it. You marry it."" Alan Parker's 1988 film which was nominated for seven Academy Awards is another reminder of what a great career Gene Hackman had, although this time he got to share the spotlight with a pair of other wonderful performances from Willem Dafoe and Frances McDormand. The fact that Mississippi Burning isn't even considered one of Hackman's top ten most popular films just proves how many great films he's made over the span of five decades (he retired from acting in 2004). Since the film was loosely based on a real incident surrounding the disappearance of some civil rights workers in the south during the 60's many people complained that the film wasn't faithful to the story, but Parker never made such a claim and always said his film was a fictional tale of events that could've taken place during the time so I don't see any need to complain about it. Some similarities can be found with the classic film directed by Norman Jewison, In the Heat of the Night, which handles a similar theme about racism. Films like this are important reminders of how dangerous humans can be when they let hate and racism govern their hearts. It is so easy at times to forget those dark moments in our history and act like they never happened, but once in a while we get films like Mississippi Burning that remind us of the horrors of humanity and the sacrifice people made to end them. These are films with important messages which also happen to be well made and count with a stellar cast. Its only Oscar win was for Peter Biziou's wonderful cinematography, but there is so much more worth recommending about this classic from the 80's. The film introduces us to three civil rights workers as they are detained by a police vehicle while they were about to exit a small Mississippi town. The officers begin making all sorts of hateful remarks towards these men and violently shoot them for trying to stir up their quiet and organized segregated town. A few days later, two FBI agents show up in town looking for these disappeared citizens, who they fear have been murdered. Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) is in charge of the operation despite his young age. His partner, Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman), is more experienced and is not afraid to speak his mind about him as someone he believes to be well educated but lacking more field work. Ward likes to do things by the books, but Anderson who was a former Sheriff in a similar Mississippi town knows the mentality of these places and believes his methods won't get them anywhere in a place like this. The Mayor (R. Lee Ermey) isn't pleased with the agents visit because he believes his segregation methods work and that things are run differently here than in the south. The agents learn it quickly while they're trying to collaborate with the local officers. Sheriff Ray Stuckey (Gaylord Sartain) is very protective of his boys, especially of Deputy Clinton (Brad Dourif) and officer Frank (Michael Rooker) who were the officers involved in the murder. It doesn't take the agents too long to realize what happened, but they can't find anyone in town who will speak to them since the victims have been threatened by the KKK. Every time someone seems to be interested in speaking up, they are immediately intimidated by the gang through violent acts. Ward's tactics don't seem to have an effect, but Anderson may have found the perfect ally in Mrs. Pell (Frances McDormand), the Deputy's wife who rejects his actions. The script handles the civil rights case with care and avoids falling into melodramatic territory by remaining gripping and suspenseful. There are plenty of thrills along the way and some violent scenes that are actually less horrifying than the hateful things these men say. It's true that the civil right theme is told through a white's man point of view, but I think it still remains compelling and well intentioned. In the end it becomes entirely a revenge action film, but it's handled in a convincing and realistic way. Hackman, Dafoe, and McDormand are in the center of the movie and they all deliver gripping performances playing off each other extremely well. Brad Dourif and Michael Rooker are given the stereotypical racist characters who are very easy to hate. Rooker seems to be playing the same character from The Walking Dead series only this time he actually acts upon his remarks more than simply being a loud mouth. Hackman and Dafoe are on the same side despite having very different approaches and that difference helps build the tension and relationships in the film. Parker's sensitive direction works in a film with such a controversial subject matter that could be easily manipulated. Mississippi Burning is a classic that shouldn't be missed by fans of Gene Hackman and his impressive career. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",0.0
1080,"The funniest movie ever made; In my opinion, this is the funniest film ever made. I didn't find it blasphemous because it doesn't make fun of Jesus or even religion. This film makes fun of religious and political fanaticism. Even the most religious or political person alive can't deny that this topic is as relevant today as it was when the film was first made. This world is full of fanatics. The movie is full of the gang's usual, well-argued fallacies. The Pythons really did their homework on this one. They make a complete mockery of serious geographical, religious and historical events and customs. According to Monty Python's history, many rejected Jesus as the Messiah because Brian was born in the stable next door. That's only the beginning of the confusion. Pontius Pilate has a speech impediment, Roman gladiatorial events have a children's matinÃ©e, Roman soldiers are Latin professors, and terrorists wanting to be freed from Roman bondage can't agree on why they hate Rome in the first place.

In September 1973, Ed Horman lost his only son and went on a long and difficult journey to find him. Within 50 years, 2 similar incidents happened in America, how's that even possible!? ""Missing"" was released in 1982 while ""Changeling"" was released in 2008. I watched both of them yesterday.

Even until now, I'm still so angry and ""amazed"" by how pathetically corrupted the law and government can be. No doubt that ""Missing"" was, is and will still be one of the most powerful and influential political thrillers ever! As usual, Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek gave stunning performances. The movie kept me in suspense until the very end. Despite the movie's length, the perfectly crafted dialogue and incidents kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire 2 hours.

8838,"One of the finest Burstyn film...; There are two reasons why I watch this film. One, its lesser known Martin Scorsese film and second it has one of finest actress Ellen Burstyn in it. Burstyn is without doubt wonderful actress who has done few films in her career but her choice of roles perfectly matches with her impeccable performances. She had no beauty or glamour to establish herself in Hollywood. Besides she was looking like mid age actress and so she has relied more on her acting talent only. Whether its classic horror 'The Exorcist' or Arnofsky's much acclaimed 'Requiem for Dream', she has tried to deliver complex characters on her sleeve. Here she played the role of Alice, a working confident woman who has multiple roles to perform in mid 80's men driven middle class society of US. Soon after the death of her husband, she has a sole responsibility to play with her annoying kid for the struggle of survival. She dreamed for second chance and the film ends with hopeful ending; quite surprising from Scorsese film. There are so many realistic scenes and dialogues one can expect from Scorsese film like- Dinner table fight between loud father and son, harassing questions asked by whining kid to her mother, emotional encounter of two individuals under intoxication in a bar or spilling water scene between mom and son. Don't get surprise to see Jodie Foster in child girl friend role of Burstyn's son. Just like most of the film buffs I also used to consider 'Taxi Driver' as her debut film but that was released in 1976. Recommended to all Scorsese fans but it's more creditworthy for wonderful Burstyn.",0.0

I would like to know if that line was actually written in the script.

The story is pretty simple but the pace is perfect and ensures that there are no slow moments and no over-rushed ones. ""Belleville"" is one of the sweetest cartoons I've seen in many years. It reminds you of being a child, but it still has qualities which makes it worth watching as a grown-up. Missing this movie is not to be recommended. The film-makers were obviously doing it for fun and their love and compassion shine throughout the movie. It might feel odd to watch a movie with so little dialog, but you get used to it quickly and I think more dialog would have ruined the nice mood and the perfect use of sound effects. The best French cartoon I've ever seen, and one of the best overall. 10/10.",0.027777777777777776

38038,"Hippity Hoppity Woo --hhhhat the!; This mediocre film was an alright watch. It definitely wasn't the best. It was super corny, even for a children's animation film. I liked the dorky type story-line though. It may be lame, but at least it was original. I watched it, wand the last reaction I had was ""what the..."" I've seen some goofy stuff, but a were-bunny? That's funny. However, as much as I say it's corky or lame, it was definitely a cute show. They have this ""Anti-Pesto"" team made up of a dog and a guy who eliminate garden pests in a town where they hold vegetables as a high value. Everyone grows vegetables to compete in a vegetable festival every year. So... you guessed it, ""Anti-Pesto is challenged with this were-rabbit situation in the most peculiar way. They try to reach this were-rabbit before this animal killing hunter tries to land the prize trophy for himself. ""Anti-Pesto"" offers bunnies sanctuary. Think they can pull it off? I think you'll be surprised on how they go about it. The animation is kind of predictable. However, it's a fun watch for a family film. It's got dorky humor that will give your little ones a laugh or two . I didn't mind this film at all, except for the bald people. It's like their foreheads are molded into eyebrows. It's hard to explain. I think it's a very enjoyable family film.",1.0

There are no words to express the obvious amount of love, wit and intelligence that goes into Nick Park's and ardmans creation. Everything in the movie works right from the beginning to the end, the writing, the voice over work, the inspired animation of the characters, it just leaps off the screen. Its so rare to find anything today that would honestly appeal to any age group on some level, but Wallace and Gromit achieves this without any effort, its just pure class, from top to bottom.",1.0
71057,"9 is a 6; 9 is better than average... but only barely. The movie is carried by a unique visual style and a great sense of ""place."" The sack-men (and woman) are refreshingly odd and fun to watch. The post-apocalyptic city is consistently beautiful and dangerous. Desolate without feeling dull. Unfortunately, the story and characters ARE dull. Not crushingly so... but enough to frustrate. Frequent, obvious plot holes and violations of established world-rules pulled me out of the movie over and over again. Tired clichÃ©s abound. I wasn't able to shake the feeling that I'd seen and heard this all before. And that's a shame because there's a lot of potential here. If only the writer had taken more chances. Why not challenge the audience and defy expectations? Why make a movie that's too scary for kids but too simplistic for adults? Who is expected to enjoy it? I would watch another Shane Acker movie if one is made (hopefully after he's picked a target audience). But 9 is not a classic. ... that said, it's probably worth watching on the big screen just for the sights and sounds.",0.0
5214,"Why the low ratings?  It's a comedy, lighten up; This movie is a delight, so I can't understand why it's rated less than 7 on IMDb.com especially since the majority of review writers rate it higher than the 6.6 composite score (38 Loved It, 8 Hated It before this review). While I wouldn't consider it a must-see (e.g. an 8 or higher rating), it's definitely worth a watch and should entertain anyone who's not hung up on 'dated' (a lazy term to use) material or is too easily offended that George Burns's character isn't consistent with the God of the Bible. First, it's supposed to be a comedy; second, it's a movie. There are almost no movies I can think of that accurately represent their source material, so don't expect this one to be any different. Besides, that John Denver's character drives an AMC Pacer actually enhances the humor for today's audience. Oh, God! (1977) is a charming film: Denver plays a credibly innocent agnostic asst. grocery store manager that comes to belief - that God exists, and that He appears to him quite casually as a kindly old codger (Burns) - such that he follows His instructions: to tell everybody that He's still with 'us' and cares, etc. Teri Garr (fabulous as always) plays Denver's wife, a true believer who, quite naturally, initially treats her husband's story about talking with God with skepticism. But after seeing how sincere he is about what's transpiring, she decides to at least believe in her husband. The couple must explain what's happening to their two children, who are embarrassed at school, and deal with disbelieving press and some stereotypical fanatics that show up at their house. The plot culminates in a court case, and I won't spoil any further. With Carl Reiner directing Larry Gelbart's cleverly written (and Oscar-nominated) screenplay, there are plenty of physical gags and chuckles (unless you take yourself too seriously). Burns delivers his dialogue as if it's off the cuff, e.g. as if God doesn't already know how everything will happen, else the comedy wouldn't work at all. There are plenty of familiar faces in supporting roles, but the film was tightly edited to 98 minutes and some of the actors ended up having little or no dialogue: Ralph Bellamy, William Daniels, Paul Sorvino (especially) and Jeff Corey have the most to say among Donald Pleasence, Barnard Hughes, Barry Sullivan, George Furth and David Ogden Stiers. Dinah Shore appears as herself.",0.0
1080,"All you need to know about religion!; Brian was born in the manger next door to that OTHER manger. In his thirties, he gets mixed up in a gang of terrorists / freedom fighters to impress a girl. This leads, through a slapstick set of coincidences, to his being taken as a messiah. THE messiah. As the multitude stalks him, we see how random individuals' bizarre perceptions turn into dogma. OK, sorry. It's really really funny, and brilliantly satirizes not only the birth of Christianity, but also nationalism, authority, mindless conformity, sterile tradition (""Why can't women go to the stoning, Mum?"" ""Because it is WRITTEN, that's why!""), political correctness, Star Wars, speech impediments, joke names, and the inevitability of missing the point (""I think he said, 'Blessed are the cheesemakers!'""). Whereas MP's Holy Grail was superbly silly, this movie is stunningly subversive. One of my fondest teenage memories is gleefully crossing the picket lines the Fundamentalists staged in front of the Tulsa theater where my friends and I first saw this movie, then saw it again every week for four weeks in a row. The distinction between the movie and real life blurred to the extent that we didn't even bother dropping acid after the first viewing. The poor drug never stood a chance against the surrealness of it all. My favorite sequence: Brian: ""You're all individuals!"" Multitude (in unison): ""Yes, we're all individuals!""

4326,"Chilling; Why had I not heard of this before? I purchased a copy of this on sale on a hunch, and boy am I glad I did. This deals with the issue of racism in a respectful and honest way, not shying away from the disgusting and awful things done in the name of ""keeping white men pure"", and yet without ever preaching. When three Civil Rights activists disappear in Mississippi, two FBI agents are sent in to solve the case. But how can they do so, when the bigotry is so rampant? This was based upon real events, though the facts were changed... some say ""too much"", and that has led to controversy surrounding the release. The portrayal of the deep South is deeply unpleasant, and one can only hope that they are nothing like the way they were in the 60's anymore. This is gripping from start to finish, exciting and also funny. The humor doesn't try hard, and all feels very natural. This is well-paced. The characters are well-written, credible and consistent. All roles are well-cast, and Hackman, Dafoe and Tobolowsky, among others, shine. The dialog is impeccably written and delivered, with countless memorable and quote-worthy lines. This is well-produced, with great editing and cinematography. Parker is known to be a dependable director, and he does not disappoint. The DVD has an interesting commentary by him, as well as a trailer. There is brutal violence, relatively frequent moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to everyone who can handle it. 8/10",0.0

This film takes place in the after a war of some sort leaving the world in shambles. A traveling man ends up taking work at a rather shady Delicatessen doing odd jobs. The movie then goes to apartment life examining the different traits of the tenants. Well our traveling man ends up going across the wrong path attempting to hook up with the Butcher's daughter...and so the life of danger begins. Well this movie is much like ""The city of lost children"" in that the background is so interesting that it tends to take from most of the film...yet the characters also hold that interest. The biggest issue I have from the film is that the characters and background tend to outshine the story itself. Otherwise I can say that this is a truly wonderful film that I'd love to watch a second time. Be wary though the language is french only.",0.0

Because it is hilarious! True, the story isn't the best component of the film, but everything else works wonders. It is essentially an irreverent and inspired send up of religious epics, and is helped brilliantly by gags and a script that is so joyfully juvenile, if extremely rude, and quotable. Quotes such as ""He's not the Messiah. He is a very naughty boy"" and ""Welease Wodewick"" had me literally peeing my pants. The sets are realistic and all of the Pythons who here take several pot shots at their favourite targets, especially Terry Jones, Graham Chapman and Michael Palin are on top form.

66097,"Darkness is not enough; ""Coraline"" has an appealing dark sensibility, and avoids the formulaic nature of so many popular films. But there's no point in being dark if you can't also be interesting, and even unpredictable films must make some sense in order to be satisfying. I haven't been this disappointed in a film in decades. It provided no dramatic momentum for ages; and even after the plot got going, none of the characters was likable enough to invest in. The three characters in peril are never really explained.The 3-D technology was wasted. The film carefully sets up a parallel universe, but then fails to make sense of the parallels, in that the parents are equally weighted in one world but wildly out of balance in the other, with no real reasoning for the discrepancy. Other reviewers praise this as a movie for ""kids who think,"" but it's more likely to be tolerated by the kind of kids who will stare at anything that passes before them. The ones who pay attention will be alternately bored, confused and creeped out. Others also praise the movie for being so ""visual,"" not noting how clumsy and redundant it is at delivering information visually and then again aurally -- the equivalent, for instance, of showing the handwritten note and then having a character read it out loud. A step backward for animated film. I did enjoy the voice work of Teri Hatcher, whose acting I have never had cause to notice before, and Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French did their best to drag in some entertainment, though their characters' voices could hardly match the less-enjoyable grotesque images. I have nothing against Neil Gaiman; I am a huge fan of ""Stardust."" But I can't understand why so many people on IMDb are using phrases like ""the best movie known to mankind.""

1080,"Shudderingly Awful; I have tried to watch this film many times. Tried, but not succeeded. The latest attempt has just failed. Anyone who criticises this film is immediately accused of finding the subject matter offensive, which couldn't be further from the truth. The concept is very funny and in the right hands could be made into a good movie. But the acting in this is woeful. Think of a group of self- congratulating nerds at college who decide to act out one of their own unfunny jokes and drag this boring skit on for over two hours. That's what you've got with this movie--a skit that might have been funny at the Oxford drama club spun out with dire acting and vulgarity. And when I use the term vulgar, I don't use it lightly. I write erotic gay novels, so I've never been accused of being a prude, but the Monty Python cast arguing about nose-picking over the Sermon on the Mount was so pathetically schoolboyish that I cringe in embarrassment for them. And that's what sums this movie up. If you find schoolboy japes and highjinks about farting and nose picking funny you'll probably like this.",0.0
50005,"The Kernel of Decay Beneath the FaÃ§ade of Opulence; Yimou Zhang once again produces a work that retains his position as one of the master builders of contemporary cinema. His ability to capture an intricate story historically based in a setting of splendor is up there with the great filmmakers. CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER is no exception. The time of the story is the Tang Dynasty, one of the more corrupt and cruel periods in Chinese history. Emperor Ping (Chow Yun Fat) has married a princess from the neighboring province, becoming Empress Phoenix (Gong Li) and in addition to becoming stepmother to the Emperor's firs-born son (Ye Liu), she bears him two additional sons (Jay Chou and Junjie Qin). Attending the palace is a doctor (Dahong Nim) and his wife (Jin Chen) who figure significantly in the family's destiny. Each of these dysfunctional family members has secrets that could destroy an empire. The Empress is clearly the titular head of the kingdom and her wily manipulations and incestuous relationships are controlled only by her doses of a medicine that is supposed to make her insane. The boils on the body of the ruling family fester until great wars break out and the royal family is revealed to be the strangely bizarre group they are. The story works (though admittedly it is often difficult to follow) because of a brilliant cast and a pacing from the director that almost matches the glory of the visual production that seems to keep growing on the screen, like a huge garden bearing more color and moods as the story progresses. Yimou Zhang is a visual artist and choreographer but he is also a man with the gift of finding the cores of his characters beneath all the glorious trappings of this films. Grady Harp",0.0

I'll compare it to The Triplets of Belleville... another French movie that I disliked for the same reasons as this one. It's just sequences of weird events.

The setting of the movie is in a house where there's a butcher who kills his apprentices to sell their meat. It's about this new unsuspecting guy he hires, and it's about the surrounding neighborhood who knows about the killings, but who do not interfere with it because they're dependent upon the meat (because there's some kind of famine in the city).

Ellen Burstyn won a well-deserved Best Actress Oscar for this role (it was especially interesting seeing her in this kind of a role, given that she'd most recently starred in ""The Exorcist""), and Kris Kristofferson, Harvey Keitel, Alfred Lutter and an androgynous Jodie Foster offer good supporting roles.

An extraordinary group of actors (with faces worthy of Fellini) play the desperate residents of an apartment where one's next meal could literally be the neighbor from down the hall.  The elastic-featured Dominique Pinon, as the clown turned handyman, is a joy to watch.

66097,"Very enjoyable animated version of a familiar story; We all know the feeling we had when we were kids: our parents are lousy; if we had another set, they'd love us cos we're just so precious. Well, this isn't exactly like that, but the premise is similar. Coraline feels neglected by her parents, that they don't make time for her or listen to her, or give her what she wants. She crawls into an alternate universe where her Other parents treat her the way she thinks she should be - food she likes, clothes she likes, all the time and attention in the world. But as in all fairy tales (and it's a fairy tale if you think parents will just give you everything you want), there is a caveat. They aren't really the good ""Other"" parents; there is a catch that I'll let you find out for yourself. It's both fun and disgusting at the same time. In the end of course, she finds out she really treasures her own real parents after all, warts and all. The process of finding that out, and a subplot of helping the other ghost children trapped there, is a visual and storytelling treat. I highly recommend this. I only wished I had caught the 3D version when it was out in the theatres - I had to watch this 2D and I had the nagging feeling I missed a 3d visual feast.",0.0

Rent the new crappy with one with Hancock Jr. From the opening frames, it is consistently funny. Hey, ma look it is so corrupt down here, you know how it is they all sleep with their sisters. The pace is great; all funny movies have slow parts, this one never stops being funny. They even put Austin Pendleton as a stammering spitting lawyer that has to be seen to be believed. I always thought Pesci could have made so many great comedies. He was wasted as a dumb sidekick in those awful Lethal Weapon movies. He is so believable as a bad ass. He really is able to covey menace despite his short size. While I am not a big fan of Marisa Tomei she does her best work here, I am not sure if it was Oscar worthy, but it is very well done. Gwynn steals the film; his exchanges with Pesci are the funniest parts of the movie. It is almost twenty years old and it is still as drop dead funny as it was way back in the 90s. I like MAD MAD WORLD but it is too long; it has parts that really drag. What makes this movie work is it is just the right length and what a great cast. Pesci and Gwynne are worth the price to see it; I own just a few comedies on blu ray but this is one of them.

1175,"A delicious (so to speak) melding of genres.; In a post-apocalyptic France of the future, meat has become exceedingly rare. So much so that it now can be used as currency. The residents of an apartment block above a deli have come to depend heavily on the strange man, Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) employed as their butcher. Then one day an entertainer named Louison (Dominique Pinon) comes to the place to accept a job as a handyman. Louison finds himself quite taken with Clapets' sexy daughter Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac), but his new life may not be what it's cracked up to be. He may have some other purpose in the building other than odd jobs. At its best, this completely off the wall and extremely stylized French take on post-nuke and cannibal cinema is one of the most original films of its kind. The co-directors, Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, give ""Delicatessen"" a striking visual design, largely avoiding cool colours like blue (although there are occasional flashes of green); the colour palette consists of a lot of yellows, oranges, reds, and browns. It's a clever hook, but also making this a worthy entertainment are the incredible energy and the consistent tone of dark, and farcical, humour. There's nothing else this viewer has seen that is quite like ""Delicatessen"", and that can only be a good thing. The performances themselves are very stylized, with the well chosen actors going for broke a lot of the time. Pinon and Dougnac are appealing in the leading roles. Also leaving a big impression are Dreyfus, Karin Viard, Ticky Holgado, Anne-Marie Pisani, Howard Vernon, and especially Silvie Laguna as the troubled Aurore, driven to stage very elaborate suicide attempts by ""voices"". Caro can be seen on screen as Fox, one of the cave dwellers. Caro and Jeunet are able to reach some appreciable heights of lunacy here, matched by the wonderfully memorable imagery throughout.

4326,"Excellent thriller with a profound message; Alan Parker's Mississippi Burning is a surprisingly good police thriller that mixes the intrigue and mystery of a police investigation with a commentary on American culture in the 1960's, and said people's attitudes towards racism. It's rare for a film to combine these elements properly, and many have failed at it, but through it's efficient pace and competent piecing together, Mississippi Burning achieves it's aim admirably. Mississippi Burning is a very professionally handled film and credit for that has to go to the director, who has a habit of putting together very professionally made films. The influence that this film has had on later crime investigation films such as the magnificent 'LA Confidential' is evident throughout, and that adds yet more credibility to the proceedings. In spite of it's turbulent plot, Alan Parker never sets out directly to shock the audience, and despite several scenes of violence, it's always the film's plot that takes centre stage and Alan Parker doesn't stray from that as many other directors have done. This film doesn't need to shock and offend to get it's message across. The plot follows the disappearance of three men - two of them white Jews and the other a young black man. We then follow the fortunes of two FBI men that come into town to investigate the disappearance. The acting in the movie is strong throughout, with William Dafoe and Gene Hackman heading a strong cast. The two stars do a great job of drawing the audience into the movie, and the two shine throughout. They are joined by a host of lesser-known stars, such as Frances McDormand, Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky and a great little turn from Michael Rooker as a racist KKK member. The themes that are implemented into the plot are impressively portrayed, with the social study being the most prominent of them. Mississippi Burning adequately denounces hatred, and does a great job of getting across the stupidity and pointlessness of it. The film is also notable for a great atmosphere throughout, which is matched by a great soundtrack that creates a very foreboding and tension filled feeling. My only real criticism of the movie is due to it's ending, which goes on a bit and kills the atmosphere that the film has done such a good job of creating. Still, this is a very good movie and one I don't hesitate to recommend!",0.0

The jokes, I should say, were hilarious. One point, the villain, Victor Quartermaine's, booty-crack was showing, prompting a character to cry out: ""BEWARE...THE MOON!!!"" Vintage Aardman! The characters are crisp and hilarious. Our favorite Aardman team of Man and Dog entertains us as only they could do, earning them their second Oscar (remember ""A Grand Day Out?""). Helena Bonham Carter was terrific as the lovely Lady Tottington, Wallace's love interest. Ralph Fiennes was especially funny and foreboding as the cunning, toupee wearing hunter Victor Quartermaine.

71057,"Good but somewhat disappointing; A little puppet rag doll machine with a 9 painted on his back comes to life in a deserted room, he opens a window to find that everything outside has been destroyed as if in a war. The best part for me was the visual design of those small rag doll machines, a mix between the evil Oogie Boogie from Nightmare Before Christmas and the protagonist Sackboy from the game Little Big Planet. I found their mechanical ""eyes"" fascinating but also distracting. The doll creatures showed emotion and some character but nowhere near the same league as Wall-E's robots who had much less to work with. To be fair, the limited (some would say lacking) characterizations of the rag doll robot creatures can theoretically be explained by their origins but that could have been better told and exploited. The animation for them was top-notch though. I liked the production design of the post-apocalyptic world but nothing blew me away. 9 is produced by Tim Burton but it doesn't have the same sense of wonder and cleverness present in most of his films so be forewarned. The action scenes were exciting and well shot but the storyline didn't feel satisfying especially the ending. The reason for the creation of the little rag doll creatures didn't make much logical sense to me. There's not much social commentary, originality (beyond visual) or humor in here that would have pushed 9 in the realm of classic. So overall, although I enjoyed the look of the film, I was left wanting in terms of story and emotional involvement. Adults would probably like it more if it was more mature, complex and darker while children would probably like it more if the characters were more personable. I wouldn't pay full price for 9 in the theatre. Rating: 6.5 out of 10",0.0

Southerners were not & still are not easily intimidated by outsiders. It is true that they respect authority, perhaps a little too much, but that's local & state authority not federal. It was actually the other way around. And if you don't believe that, then remember this, Southerners ran out the mafia during prohibition with their ultimate ways of dispatching one creatively. Southerners take great pride in running out Capone & his ilk by using such measures as sticking a guy to a post & stuffing his testicles in his mouth that were bitten off by a calf. Hence the reason the mafia shifted to Canada for their bootlegging. In spite of all that, I know how Hollywood likes to distort things for the purposes of entertainment & emotional interests. (i.e. KKK in ""A Time To Kill,"" ""Top Gun,"" etc.) So, taking that into consideration, this film was awesome! Willem Dafoe is pretty good but the highlight is Gene Hackman as he delivers yet again in a role reminiscent of his ""Popeye Doyle"" role! Even though it was pure hogwash, there are vital facts still in the story & to watch Hackman go to work on the guy from ""Cuckoo's Nest"" is classic & probably the inspiration for Russell Crowe's character in ""L.A. Confidential!"" Bottom line, my historical anal retentiveness put aside...9/10",0.0
19,"A pure gut-buster; ACE VENTURA: WHEN NATURE CALLS, in my opinion, is a pure gut-buster. I laughed REALLY hard when Ace (Jim Carrey) sang ""The Slinky Song,"" imitated jungle animals, and mocked the Monopoly guy (Michael Reid MacKay). As a matter of fact, I laughed at just about every funny thing he did. In addition, I have a LOT of favorite parts of this movie -- Especially when Ace picked up the skunk and said, ""Say hello to my stinky friend."" Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""If you're going to see this movie, prepare to laugh until it hurts!"" Now, in conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend this gut-busting comedy to those of you who are Jim Carrey fans or like gut-busting laughs.",0.0

Jim Carrey brings out the Ace Ventura like no one else can (possibly because no one else wants to do an impression from they're butt).  Humor comes in heavy doses, like the first one, and I laughed at a lot of it.  But it's just that this one seemed done before, and not as good as the first.  Still though, for Carrey fans (or for people looking for a laugh), this film is for you. A",0.0
6773,"Analysis of Imagery; Madame Souza's Super Powers Two scenes are analyzed here form a brilliant short film about a Grandmothers journey to getting her grandson to the Tour de France bicycle race and eventually saving him after he is kidnapped by a group of mob men. In the first scene, the tiny kitchen looks even smaller with the over the top clutter that fills it. Along the walls: plates, tea sets, wine bottles, a bike frame, pots, and pans all line wooden board panels. An antique, rusty record player stands in a corner. In the opposite corner, a full trash bin accompanies an aged steel heater. The already overcrowded walls hold picture frames that tilt to one side. In the center of the room above a round kitchen table, there is a brittle light fixture. The light sways back and forth lighting the room with dull light bulbs. Madame Souza is standing on top of her table. The old woman is elf- sized and plump. She hovers over her grandson, Champion, who is on his hands and knees on top of the table too. His feet dangle over the edge of the table as she vigorously scrubs his shoulders after a long day of bike riding. Champion's eyes are closed. His back arches with hunched shoulders. As the night grows, the scene ends Madame dragging the giant to bed. Later in the film, the second scene is positioned mountainside during the Tour de France race. The driver and Madame Souza have pulled over on the side of the road due to a tire malfunction. Madame Souza is standing with one foot forward supporting her body as she leans over the older man that drives her van. She has both hands on her rounded hips, and constantly blows a whistle cradled in her mouth. With furrowed eyebrows, the driver bends over- focused on trying to fix the popped tire. She is anxious to get back on the road to keep track of her grandson during the race. In both of these images from Les Triplettes de Belleville, Sylvain Chomet portrays a distinct gender role switch- empowering the female role and diminishing the dominant male perception. The two scenes are in direction toward a group of outer-directed consumers. Many people have very set views of the male and female roles in our society. Both of these scenes portray a reversed dominance in the traditional view of leadership by a male and following logic from the female. While Madame Souza stands in her kitchen with Champion, she is above him, even though he is three times her size. Her gaze is looking downward onto Champion. His eyes are closed. His body in a prayer position with his shoulders arching down. He shows reverence to his grandmother as she scrubs his back. Similarly, Madame stands a whole head above the the truck driver when they are on the side of the mountain. Both of her eyes are looking through her nose at the old man. Obediently, he looks down at the task that Madame is urging he finishes. Her nose points upward in a posh shrewdness. The driver keeps his head below his shoulders in compliance with her orders. In both scenes however, the angle of the camera is at eyelevel. This angle gives the viewer a rhetorical perspective of equality with the characters, therefore creating equilibrium between the audience and characters. In the kitchen scene with Champion and Madame Souza, we are overwhelmed with a feeling of clutter and chaos. In traditional views, the role a woman is to keep and maintain the house. This observation includes the idea of keeping the home clean and neat at all time- at least to try. Madame Souza does not show this characteristic. Her objective is inclined to training and coaching Champion for the race. The imagery of ""coaching"" replicates in the second seen with the driver as well. Normally the word ""coach"" associates itself with a male. However, Madame Souza takes the role of the coach and blows the whistle at the old man in this scene. Chomet uses color and specific detail in the animation to represent the ideas intended for a parallel audience. The driver is wearing scruffy overalls that infer is a lower class worker. Madame Souza wears worn out clothes, a sweater that has patches on her elbows. The colors and wardrobe of the cartoons evoke an idea that they belong to a lower middle class group. The detail by Chomet effectively demonstrates his point of view concerning the female role in the film. She and her assistants in the film are the ""heroes."" Throughout the film, Madame Souza carries a tremendous character of leadership, which completely contradicts our view of an elderly woman in society today. She exceeds the role of a woman demonstrating: power, will, nurture, and protection for her loved ones. I believe this short film is inspiring to try the hardest one can at any given point and time in life. The grandma instructs no one should give up no matter how tough any situation may seem. The human anatomy is only flesh and bones. The soul is the strength and will that comes from within.",0.027777777777777776
745,"Highly enjoyable; 'Wallace and Gromit: A Close Shave' is a short featuring the clay animation characters Wallace (an inventor) and Gromit (the inventor's pet dog, who seems to be smarter than the inventor and often the star of the show). This tale also features Sean the Sheep and a plot against Wallace and Gromit by a sheep thief. This is another highly enjoyable episode. It is a rare breed of film that can entertain both adults and children alike. Children and adults will enjoy the imaginative sequences, lovable characters, comical events, and animation. This is a must-see animation no matter what your age or gender is. There is something for everyone, and it is thoroughly enjoyable. Well done.",1.0
50005,"Never mess with the Emperor!; This is a film from Director Zhang Yimou about Emperor Ping (Chow Yun-Fat) of the Tang Dynasty and his newly crowned Empress Phoenix (Gong Li), who has developed a secret affair with her elder stepson, Prince Wan (Liu Ye). In addition, the Emperor's controlling ways over the kingdom have been challenged and questioned by middle son Prince Jai (Jay Chou) and the ailing Empress. This all leads to a brilliant and dramatic display of rebellion, corruption, jealousy and war as Prince Jai and the Empress attempt to overthrown the evil Emperor. The setting of the magnificent Forbidden City was done in such beauty and color that it will leave you in awe at its stunning display of majesty and power. I have visited the Forbidden City a few times and it was great to see it portrayed in the movie when it was the home of powerful royalty. The costumes used for the cast, especially that of the beautiful Empress, were exquisite and elegant and, at just over an hour and a half, this movie had just the right amount of drama and action to make it entertaining and worth the view when I first saw it on a plane ride. ***spoiler ahead*** I wished that the ending could have been different, for example, showing the Emperor getting a taste of his own bitter medicine. However, I guess it just shows how far a king would go to preserve his legacy and grip on power and how even the most powerful and seemingly prosperous family could meet its decline through greed and misfortune. ***spoiler ends*** Overall, it's a stunning movie that really showcases the majestic and supreme life of royalty in ancient China.

71057,"A solid film that doesn't live up to its full potential; Aside from perhaps The Princess and the Frog (and, prior to May 29th, Up), there hasn't been a single movie this year that I've been looking forward to more than Shane Acker's debut film, 9. The basic premise, while somewhat familiar, really intrigued me, and the art direction looked superb. Along with a decidedly darker tone than most animated films, this one definitely looked like it had potential to be one of the all-time greats. But does 9 live up to its full potential? WellÂ…not quite. On the positive side (and as one would guess from the trailers), the movie looks spectacular. By use of both the environments and the characters, this harsh, post-apocalyptic world feels extremely real, and successfully draws you into the film. I simply couldn't take my eyes off of the art on display here. The voice acting is also relatively solid. Jennifer Connelly as 7, the strong-willed warrior of the group, and Christopher Plummer as 1, the gang's self-proclaimed leader, are especially terrific in their roles. As much as the visuals draw you into the film, and as strong as the voice acting is, though, the story feels pretty bland, and in fact, is littered with several gaping plot holes. The movie is also quite short, and with the majority of it centered on the action, I don't think I had enough time to connect with any of these characters. There was only one scene in which I truly felt attached to them, which was toward the end, with the song ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" playing throughout. To me, as well as a few other people that I've spoken to, that was easily the best scene in the film. Overall, 9 is a thoroughly entertaining film with beautiful animation and a strong voice cast. Unfortunately, the story itself ends up being pretty dull, and not as complex as one might hope. It's still a solid film, and I look forward to whatever Shane Acker's next project is (animated or otherwise). However, it simply doesn't live up to the potential that I thought it had.",0.0

6773,"A unique, ingenious, hilarious, gorgeously-animated feature; I got to see ""Triplets of Belleville"" at the Telluride Film Festival, where it was screened along with ""Destino,"" the recently completed Dali/Disney collaboration based on sketches and storyboards that are nearly sixty years old.  A lot of folks went to the screening just to see Destino.  It was OK, sort of a montage of various Dali images that blend into each other. ""Triplets,"" however, turned out to be one of the finest animated features I've ever seen, and I've been a rabid fan  of just about all types of animation since I was in diapers. The combination of the film's exquisite artwork and the gentle humor of the story kept me completely enthralled for the whole running time.  The story is about a tight-knit little family consisting of a fanatically devoted young cyclist, his shrewlike but determined mother, and the increasingly bloated family dog.  To say that sight gags abound would be an understatement.  While the character design and backgrounds are substantially more intricate and the animation more fluid, the visual style is reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's cartoons in Monty Python And The Holy Grail, etc.  Every character's features are dramatically exaggerated, from the protagonist's massive, Gallic nose, and swollen biker's calves, to the dog's 400:1 torso-to-leg proportions.  The mobster goon squad that collects overheated bikers during the Big Race (to be installed in a bizarre, underground gambling-oriented exhibit) are particularly hilarious--essentially a pair of giant, black, fedora-sporting monoliths a la 2001.  Two of them frequently link up and trot down ill-lit hallways like modular furniture come to life.  An appropriately goofball approach to physics accompanies these characters and the wacky spaces they frequent. The story has some creepy edges, but it remains very warm and light-hearted (in an intelligent, non-sappy way) all the way through.  And the music is terrific! It was announced at the screening that ""Triplets"" has been picked up by Sony Pictures Classics, which is very good news.  Here's hoping this wonderful film finds as wide as possible distribution in the US and elsewhere, and I'm already anticipating the DVD release.  It would be great to hear a commentary from or see interviews with the French/Canadian/Belgian crew behind this one.  Great job, guys (and gals).  Can't wait for your next project!",0.027777777777777776
66097,"Coraline thinks the other world is a dream come true... but she's wrong.; I finally saw Coraline on the big screen today, and it was an absolute feast for the eyes. That Real Digital 3D is very impressive. Yes it's a gimmick, but it works so very well. I can see why so many animated movies are using this technology this year. The images have so much depth, and the visuals are absolutely gorgeous. Anyways onto the film. Coraline Jones is an adventurous girl with a huge imagination. When her family moves to a new house in a new town, Coraline is bored out of her mind. Her parents don't pay a lot of attention to her, so when she finds a strange door, her curiosity peaks. It leads to an ""other"" world which includes her mother and her father. However, they're very different. They have buttons for eyes and they seem a lot more interested in her. She refers to them as her other mother and her other father. She sees this world as a dream come true, but it really is one of the most terrifying worlds around. The voice work is all very good, Terri Hatcher does a wonderful job playing Coraline's mothers. I also really liked the team of Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, who played the very funny Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, two stage performers. Their play was particularly memorable. Henry Selick's direction is very, very good. A lot of the scenes reminded me of The Nightmare Before Christmas. A lot of the shadows, and even some of the animation had a very Nightmare Before Christmas-esquire vibe. I'm glad he got out of Tim Burton's shadow. All in all, it's a very entertaining film. 8/10",0.0
5540,"Harryhausen rules!; There is just enough time before the CGI remake arrives and re-colours one's memories to post a review of Ray Harryhausen's final film. In a second visit to classical Greek mythology, a heavily modified version of Perseus' battle with the Gorgon Medusa features, in the leading role, Harry Hamlin who is, to be frank, rather less dramatically credible than Harryhausen's animated creations. There are the usual shenanigans on Mount Olympus featuring Laurence Olivier as Zeus in charge of an unnecessarily stellar bunch of gods and goddesses. Burgess Meredith gives a sprightly turn playing essentially the same role to Hamlin's Perseus as he did to Stallone's Rocky. Assorted minor British supporting actors perform perfectly serviceably in a range of supporting roles. And Judi Bowker - elegant, vulnerable, and so beautiful that her porcelain delicacy brings tears to your eyes - reminds one that she is a much missed absence from the screen following her effective retirement to occasional TV work after this film. But the real stars are, of course, Harryhausen's stop motion creations, where the Oscar goes to Medusa - the most chilling chunk of rubber on a steel armature ever created. And the booby prize goes to the hugely unwelcome R2D2-lite comedy clockwork owl Bubo, the least necessary character in any movie ever (please please please don't let there be a Bubo in the remake). Not for nothing is it named after bubonic plague pustules. This is a hugely enjoyable movie, and a fitting capstone to Harryhausen's career.",0.0
6493,"Throw the Writer Out the Window; Spoilers herein. I love self-referential scripts. This one was clearly written under pressure and delivered  before its time.

I will admit that the movie is quite trippy, and even frightening in some parts, and certainly not meant for kids under the age of 10. The best way I can describe it is Alice in Wonderland on crystal meth. It's a beautifully done movie visually and has a wonderful plot and story, but it is also very bizarre and even creepy.

1175,"The brilliant debut of Caro & Jeunet; In the late 70s, french director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and designer Marc Caro met and found they shared a lot of interests in the visual arts, their friendship soon became an artistic team that would spent the whole 80s making short films where the duo was able to explore and master the cinema language, perfecting their storytelling abilities and visual design skills, preparing themselves to make a career in film-making. Their efforts were crowned in 1991, when they were finally able to take their craft to a full feature length film, in the project that would become their breakthrough in the film industry and the proper beginning of their careers as filmmakers: the post-apocalyptic comedy ""Delicatessen"". The world of ""Delicatessen"" is a dark bleak France where there is apparently no law and food is incredibly sparse (and is now used as currency). In this post-apocalyptic world, the residents of an apartment building in the middle of nowhere have found a solution to the hunger thanks to their landlord, the butcher Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus), who from time to time kills the building's handyman to feed the bizarre group of tenants. One day, former clown Louison (Dominique Pinon) arrives to the building and gets the handyman position, but unfortunately for Clapet and the other tenants, the butcher's daughter Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac) has fallen in love with Louison, and will do whatever is necessary to stop the madness of the delicatessen. Written by Gilles Adrien (who also wrote many of the previous Jeunet & Caro shorts) as well as Jeunet & Caro themselves, ""Delicatessen"" is a wonderfully imaginative tale of sweet romance and hilarious black comedy that gives an unexpected light-hearted twist to a plot that most writers would treat as a serious subject matter. And surprisingly it works, as while the story is anything but complex, the assortment of strange (yet very human) characters that populate the world of ""Delicatessen"" truly become the movie's soul. And not only the main characters, as every single one of them (no matter how small the role is) is highly detailed and serves a specific function as if the whole building was one of the odd machines that still work in this post-apocalyptic portrait of France. Visually, the film is simply sublime. Since the directors decided to divide responsibilities, Marc Caro took full control of the production design and the artistic elements of the movie, so with this freedom Caro's inventive artistic vision reaches new heights creating a movie that could be described as a moving canvas. Highly atmospheric, the french duo takes the cinematography (by Darius Khondji) to the next level mixing techniques and showing a whole range of influences that go from German Expressionism to 40s modernism, resulting in one of the most beautiful looking movies ever done. Still, the movie is more than a visual fest, as Jeunet (in charge of guiding the actors) shows a complete domain over his cast & crew keeping the many elements of the film working nicely in the right place. As written above, the characters are the film's soul, and the ensemble of actors playing them really made a terrific job in the film. Dominique Pinon (who would become one of Jeunet's regular collaborators) delivers a subtle and charming performance as the ex-clown Louison. He is very believable in the role, and gives the character a very human touch, essential for the kind of character he is playing. The same can be said of Marie-Laure Dougnac, who plays Louison's love interest, Julie, one of the ""more normal"" characters in the movie. Jean-Claude Dreyfus as Clapet the Butcher is simply delightful as the story's ""villian"", and basically every member of the cast delivers an unforgettable performance no matter how long or short is their screen time (Silvie Laguna for example, is really wonderful). ""Delicatessen"" is a solid debut by this two skillful french artists, and it already shows why the two quickly became an important team in the French fantasy cinema. Their very own brand of surrealist fantasy flows freely through the film making a unique visual fest (although it definitely goes a bit over-the-top at times), and while it doesn't reach the artistic level of their follow-up (the 1995 classic ""La CitÃ© Des Enfants Perdus""), it's still a nicely done movie that most importantly, never gets boring or tiresome. Unlike their later films, ""Delicatessen"" may not be for everyone, as it's mix of black comedy and surreal fantasy may seem at times too close to absurd to be enjoyable. However, those with a taste for the bizarre will find a great movie in this French comedy. While ""Delicatessen"" still shows the excess of the young and raw talent of Jeunet & Caro, it's not hard to see why they became known worldwide after this initial success, as this movie shows the enormous potential of their skills as filmmakers. This brilliant mixture of genres is definitely a very recommended movie, and like ""La CitÃ© Des Enfants Perdus"" (""City of the Lost Children""), an essential film of the 90s. 8/10",0.0

Even then I was laughing all the way through, though of course different jokes were funny back then. I remember collapsing to the floor it fits of hysteria in the space scene. As one grows older, the true nature of the comedy reveals itself however. This is a movie with a message in it, and the message is ""beware"".... or rather, the message is think about your life, think about who you are and follow yourself. Believing in something is fine... just don't follow blindly. Question your faith, and if you find answers that strengthen it, then you've found something special. All those who find this movie blasphemous obviously haven't learned how to work it out for themselves. Terrific race the Romans... terrific.",0.0
1148,"""No more lodgers - more trouble than they're worth""; There's no use prevaricating about the bush, 'Wallace & Gromit in The Wrong Trousers (1993)' is a whole heap of fun! Having not seen the film in years, I'd almost forgotten that it was so uproariously entertaining. It was 'Creature Comforts (1989)' that took home the Oscar in 1991, but Nick Park instead planned a sequel to 'A Grand Day Out with Wallace and Gromit (1989),' a short film that, in my estimation, showed far more promise. This next effort sees the pair with their feet firmly on terra firma, but in an adventure that is no less wacky than the last. Despite economic woes, Wallace has built a impressive contraption for Gromit's birthday Â– a pair of mechanical trousers. To offset his financial losses, Wallace opens up his home to lodgers, attracting the business of a creepy and silent penguin named Feathers McGraw. The sinister flightless avian soon sets about systematically severing the immortal bond between master and pet, in preparation for a devilishly cunning heist scheme. Nick Park's films are held in reverence by the animation community, and with good cause. Rarely before had the claymation medium been utilised to create such rich animated characters; even previous successes like 'Closed Mondays (1974)' couldn't evade the fact that they were produced using shifting masses of clay. 'The Wrong Trousers' boasts but three characters Â– only one of which can speak Â– and yet the relationship between the three is superbly authentic. Maybe it's the personal touch of recognising the animators' thumb-prints on every character, but somehow Park manages to capture every nuance of their behaviour, every tiny inflection of emotion. In half an hour, Gromit doesn't utter a single word, and yet he communicates his sadness, anger and excitement through an affectionate glance or downcast eye. Likewise, the sinister Feathers McGraw attains creepiness precisely through his silence. That he doesn't speak keeps his motives veiled in secrecy, and those beady, ominous eyes are probably enough to give young children nightmares. Of course, most people love 'The Wrong Trousers' for its humour, and there's plenty of it. That sparkling British humour is truly allowed to shine, and the gentle voice-acting of Peter Sallis has the sheer sincerity to carry the frequently-offbeat jokes. Whereas 'A Grand Day Out' was a homage of sorts to the science-fiction genre, probably more in line with Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s than anyone else, this effort is an affectionate satire of the British crime films of the 1950s and 1960s. The evil penguin has the eccentric malevolence of Alec Guinness in 'The Ladykillers (1955),' though without the fondness for articulate speech. The object of the villainous heist scheme resembles the titular jewel in 'The Pink Panther (1964).' With mock seriousness, amateur sleuth Gromit paces his way through the clichÃ©s of the genre, culminating in a hilarious madcap locomotive chase along miniature train-tracks, which our hero must lay down as he goes. This sort of impeccable entertainment deserves to run for far longer than thirty minutes.",1.0
6773,"Don't Bother Finding Nemo. Rendez Vous With Belleville.; The review which couples the IMDb webpage for Belleville has a commentator claiming that this is a Pixar world. Well a pox on Pixar and a pox on you. In a world where Pixar is merely setting the benchmark for recycled story lines involving ever changing animals and settings which is then in turn lapped up by prepubescents and alas most generic movie goers, animation around the world is reminding us not only in what medium it all began, but more importantly, how to make damned good cinema that talking fish could never achieve. Belleville is a glorious piece of cinematic work that encompasses the grander elements of the human condition in hardwork, loyalty and love. Wonderfully defined, the animation in Belleville is of the highest degree, with perfect angular landscapes and characatural inhabitants. It is simplistic yet delicate and complex. It grows with each viewing, and deserves ample praise. This film is not merely about pencil and paper. Belleville deserves to be recognised up there with Spirited Away, and one can only hope that writers of Madagascar, and the ilk, lie awake at night and are ashamed. The first three minutes of the film set the tone, for never has a theme stuck in my head quite like the rendition of the films title song. The irony being that these are the only moments in which words are said. This is not a silent film, as dogs bark and trains charge down rail tracks, but it proves when something is this good the story will speak for itself, and no translation is needed to understanding emotional warmth, and the bond between family. It is not, however to be taken lightly, as it harbours some severely macabre moments, with its plot moving in unpredictable (unless you read the back of the box) ways. It is by no means violent, but it is dark in parts if through moments of sadness than anything else, and thus will work through a wider range of levels than ""in-jokes"" in a Pixar flick. A Pixar flick may provide the odd ""older"" reference, but adults will never derive the sense of satisfaction and betterment than they will through this film, as nothing is ever forced, not least through mundane dialogue. Suffice to say Belleville Rendezvous is animation personified. It highlights the ability to express ideas, and create films in a way which is simply not possible with actors and a camera. And for all the razzmatazz of ever increasingly developed computer generated imagery, it will never gift you the same pleasures as being able to sense the hard work and devotion placed into a film such as this. While Disney have turned their backs on the very foundations on which they layed, the rest of the world have furthered those ideas, and simply made them infinitely better, and this is but one example.",0.027777777777777776
1175,"Delicatessen.....; After recently watching this movie in a film studies lesson at school was left with an unsettled opinion. The film itself is undoubtedly outstanding in its artistic individuality, with Jeunet and Caro creating a masterpiece which is praised by film critics and viewers alike. Throughout the film the lavish use of colour and various shot types are what make the film such a wonder to watch. Jeunet uses alternative camera angles to create a somewhat obscure feeling whilst watching. The use of angles is especially what makes us feel like we are not only watching a movie but that we are becoming part of Jeunet and Caro's wondrous creation. The humour is somewhat bizarre but is still presented to us in a way which can be appreciated audiences; especially with Aurores various attempts at suicide and the distinguishing ways in which characters are filmed and presented. The overall plot itself contains some form of humour; boy meets girl and girl's father tries to use him for meat, this all being set in an apocalyptic future. To me that does not sound like a typical romantic comedy, giving the film an element of (as I have already stated) individuality but it also makes it quite charming. The overall film itself is very unconventional, especially with all the cinematic stylistic techniques and the individual touches added by the directors. However although I am able to appreciate this film in all its cinematic beauty I still find that I am unable to say that I am greatly fond of it. Yes, I think that it is a work of art by Jeunet and Caro and Yes, I think that it's highly appealing to some but I do not find the overall idea of the film that interesting. I would watch it again to be left in awe of the way it was made, but I don't think I would watch it as a form of entertainment. It is almost as if I appreciate this film for its artistic importance, much like a Shakespeare play or a Monet painting, rather than appreciate the film for actually being a film.",0.0
4326,"Atmosphere aplenty; What a Cracking Movie everything from the performances of everyone to the music which really sums the up film.The sultry southern heat encapusulates the whole mood of the movie,which to me is some great undulating power always threatening to break through and bowl over every character in the film. Gene Hackman is terrific so is William Dafoe and it deals with the bare fact that racism is taught and the fact that people will revel in their ignorance maintaining that they are right until the day they die . The one thing about this movie that you don't get in other films is mood there is a great mood to the whole film as pointed out earlier always keeping you on the edge of your seat thinking that something is gonna or about to happen",0.0
2302,"courtroom comedy; Joe peso excels in this piece of courtroom comedy where he takes his first murder case as an out of town lawyer in the deep south. there are the usual errors of a new lawyer. though the judge is suspicious, the judge accepts Vinnie the lawyers assurance of an impressive record of some wins and losses and permits Vinnie despite reservations to try a case where the ultimate penalty hangs over both defendants. Fred Gwynn a long time comic actor plays the part of a Superior Court Judge eloquently with reserve and detachment. while this is a romantic comedy, the comic aspects of the story are adjunctive to the seriousness of the charges for which both defendants face death. though utterly inexperienced before an hostile court, Vinny manages with a little help from his girl friend Mona to draw victory in a case of mistaken identity from the jaws of defeat. the harshness of the new yawk accent is tastefully in this film executed as the perfect counterpoint to the sense of dignity and propriety of the ever staid southland. the film qualifies as a classic comedy as it ends with a promise of marriage.",0.0
5540,"Harryhausen's swansong and a childhood favourite; Sadly, this was the last movie for stop-motion man Ray Harryhausen, and therefore the last real fantasy epic made in Britain (whoever said KRULL, I said ""real""!). While not as visually impressive as JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS - and let's face it, how could it be? This being an '80s film compared to a '60s film after all - CLASH OF THE TITANS certainly has moments where it recaptures some of the magic of Harryhausen's golden years and these alone make the film worth watching. Relying heavily on Greek mythology as a basis, CLASH OF THE TITANS is set aside from other muscleman entries by having a number of scenes set in the supposed palace of the Gods, who spend most of their time bickering and arguing like little children. Laurence Olivier is Zeus. No, he IS Zeus. I've heard some people complain about his performance but I can't imagine anyone else being as stern and authoritative in the role. Basically, it seems like it was written for him, and Olivier is great. Let's say no more about it. Zeus' companions are played by Maggie Smith (great at being ""evil""), Claire Bloom and an almost unnoticeable Ursula Andress, a Goddess of Standing Around in the Background and Looking Beautiful. These scenes serve to give the movie a heavyweight backbone and act as a basis for the plot, which is basically a string of action scenes where Perseus and his companions battle whatever twisted creation comes next from the genius mind of Ray Harryhausen. I'm not sure of the budget with this film, but I'm guessing it was quite high with most of the cash being eaten away by the wealth of stars appearing. However, the photography is colourful and great to look at, the film is well made throughout and the various historical landscapes - generally swathed in atmospheric mist and fog - are all excellent, most being filmed in the Mediterranean to give an extra oomph. The only thing really lacking is a noticeable score along the lines of Bernard Herrmann, but I can forgive that. Harry Hamlin is cast as Perseus, the toned hero. It always amuses me how the Italians always had bodybuilders as their mythical heroes while us British made do with athletic but generally skinny guys along the lines of Kerwin Matthews and John Philip Law. Hamlin is probably one of the most wooden heroes in a film of this variety, and almost totally lacking in charisma too. Thankfully the producers recognised this flaw and so give him little emoting to do, instead just run around a lot and look pretty. Andromeda is played by Judi Bowker, a ravishing beauty who looks a lot like Linda Hayden, which is no bad thing. Also cast as a sidekick is the inimitable Burgess Meredith, who is still quite good even though he really doesn't have anything to do. Also appearing are the likes of Flora Robson and Freda Jackson as disturbing Stygian witches, extremely clichÃ©d creations (and blind too) but still masterpieces of the grotesque. Being a post-Star Wars movie aimed at kids, they had to throw in a mechanical creation a la R2-D2, so we have to put up with an annoying tin owl which makes lots of stupid noises throughout the movie and seems more a home in a science fiction epic than a supposed fantasy. I remember thinking that the owl was really cute as a kid but it just grates now as an adult. Once again, Harryhausen's excellent stop-motion creations dominate the film and here are some of his finest models in his entire filmography. The best of the lot has to be the Medusa, a ferocious-looking creature who through the use of shadow actually manages to look quite terrifying, and certainly scared me LOADS as a kid. It certainly beats the Italian variant in MEDUSA VS THE SON OF HERCULES, what a load of rubbish that was in comparison! After Hamlin cuts off the monster's head (a great-looking prop too), we get to witness oozing blood from the neck wound, an image ingrained in my memory since childhood and still pretty disgusting to this day. Like the Baboon in SINBAD AND THE EYE OF THE TIGER, there is also a ""good"" creature here, which this time is the Pegasus, again a well-animated beast which is slightly overused. Also appearing are a giant vulture (good), a horned troll-creature (very good, and almost devilish in look), a trio of nasty scorpions, a two-headed dog (very realistic this one) and to top it all, a gigantic Kraken which threatens to give the colossal statue in JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS a run for its money. Other non-Harryhausen but fun effects include skeleton boatman Charon rowing across the River Styx (creepy, and a perfect representation of the Grim Reaper) and the destruction of Argos, complete with tidal waves and falling masonry - simply stupendous! Being the '80s, the audience demand for graphic violence was at a high, so we get to see the various creatures bleed a lot too as they are hacked to death by our heroes and there's a lot of general violence to enjoy. In all, CLASH OF THE TITANS was great fun as a kid and is still pretty enjoyable today, and even if it pales in comparison to Harryhausen's earlier work it's still a fitting finale for the master of stop-motion.",0.0
1080,"Falls below Python's usual standards:(; This is HORRIFIC movie. It's horrific for the worst reason..it's a python movie and it's not funny! This goes to show you that when Monty Python tries to go bigger and more serious, they fail. One thing that also brings it down is the fact that so many religious people are ranting about how it's ""an affront to God"" or ""It's sacrilege and ""Monty Python is an agent from Satan"" etc. I didn't see any of that in the movie. The Sermon on the Mount scene or the line ""He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!"" may be a little touchy to some people but that's it. The rest of the movie is not funny at all. The ""we're supposed to haggle!"" scene is funny and the ""Always look on the Bright Side of Life"" music number is great but that's it.

38038,"Wallace & Gromit in the Curse of the Were-Rabbit; Wallace & Gromit has always been the phenomenon that eluded me. Every once in awhile I would be flipping channels and come across a short on BBC, but never took the time to actually watch one completely. When the film came out last year it seemed cute enough, however, the lauded praise and fanfare was surprising to me, as well as the Oscar (granted Pixar was MIA in 2005). Finally I was able to catch up with the animated feature and upon completion I must say first impressions were correct. Wallace & Gromit in the Curse of the Were-Rabbit is an enjoyable little film that doesn't break any ground in storytelling, but is a feat of construction. Unfortunately in this case the wonderful visuals can't overcome a lackluster plot. Aardman definitely has inventive minds at work for them. The characters are all well fleshed out and nicely orchestrated. Each voice is original and cartoony in a good way. Almost like a vaudeville performance, the script is read articulately and showy. Even the name actors like Ralph Fiennes and Helena Bonham Carter are unrecognizable in their roles. This performance style helps greatly in creating the atmosphere desired with the movie. The animation is a big factor as well with facial features becoming distorted for every emotion. Just the ability to have Gromit the dog be articulate and understandable in stop motion animation, while never uttering a sound, is amazing. Craftsmanship astounds at every turn. Where the film falls flat is in the material being portrayed. The allusions are amusing with references to Beauty and the Beast and Frankenstein, among many others, yet the gleaning from other sources soon becomes a bit tedious to the point where you know where the story is headed. With a plot progression as telegraphed as this one, I started to feel a bit restless as the really funny parts became too staggered to keep my interest. Yes the visual puns are great most times, (the angel wings and devil horns in the meeting scene), the hidden text a delight, (the car's window sticker, the cheese box label, the radio buttons), however, the sexual innuendoes got old and finally just elicited groans rather than chuckles. I almost feel the film would have been more successful either by going full-blown British and adult, or strictly child-driven without the crassness. Instead I feel the brilliant artistic merits are overshadowed by a mixed bag of gags and confused overall feel that never finds its way. Perhaps the switch to feature length created a need for filler in its almost 90 minute runtime, and hopefully when I get a chance to check out the shorts I will experience a tighter storyline and more enjoyable pieces of work.",1.0

Nick Park has a solid reputation for delivering the goods and this is his greatest achievement to-date. It's, to paraphrase Wallace, a cracking film for all ages. There are great references to other movies that should appeal to the movie buff element of the audience and enough general jokes to please everybody. My eyes were watering with laughter throughout. The film looks great, as you'd expect from Nick Park. The level of detail is simply staggering and the visual gags are breathtaking. Clever stuff, indeed.

This famous man and dog duo are simply impossible to dislike. 'A Close Shave' is another wonderfully imaginative and entertaining short and, like the rest in the series, a film that just never gets old no matter how many times you've seen it. The attention to detail and the amount of effort that must have gone into every frame is mind blowing. No special effects or CGI, just plasticine and a hell of a lot of time and effort.

Subtle (and not so subtle) humour is mixed in with superb animation (or claymation as Aardman like to call it) and an original entertaining storyline to give us ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"". Wallace and Gromit's village is plagued with rabbits at the time of the annual giant vegetable competition and their latest business venture is as humane pest controllers. Watch out for visual gags and listen out for the numerous puns. Unfortunately, the cinema trailer gives a lot of the plot away, which slightly detracted from our overall enjoyment. Our 4 year old loved it as did we: memories of ""Watership Down"" were stirred on one occasion! A superb English voice cast enhanced the enjoyment: Helena Bonham Carter as Lady Tottington was great. My favourite character was the vicar. Fans of Hammer House of Horror and old Dracula and Werewolf movies will have a good chuckle. Enjoy!",1.0
1080,"Nothing can be as original as this.; I've never been a huge fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus as most of it is far too over the top with blunt humour to boot. Wasn't too keen on The Meaning Of Life either and as for The Holy Grail, well that was pretty good but still was rubbish in places. Life of Brian on the other hand is extremely watchable and quite funny for the Monty Python crew where the humour still isn't the sharpest but it doesn't need to be. My favourite part has to be when Brian is being took away by the Roman soldiers and Judith starts to smack the back of John Cleese's Roman centurion character and her final smack knocks his helmet crooked and he turns round and says ""stop it"" but it was the way he said it which had be laughing my head off! Just little things like that which makes this the best Python movie. Graham Chapman as Brian is great as he plays his charachter in a similar way as he did Arthur in Holy Grail (being funny by being serious), shame he died a while back as he is one of my favourite Pythons. Has to be admired for its originality and i think Life Of Brian is for anyone and yeah the song at the end 'Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life' is a nice way from stopping the movie having a tragic end which would have been a terrible thing for a comedy spoof flick but the song is annoying so why they released it into the British pop charts in the early 90's is beyond me even though Eric Idle's performance on Top Of The Pops was funny. Funniest film ever? Nope. A very funny film? Yes indeedy. 8/10",0.0
6493,"Better if a theatrical play but not a screenplay; Book lovers forever love and support movies with stories related to books, writer, writing books etc, Possession, The Ninth Gate, The Name of the Rose etc are all my favourites, and this is no exception. Writer's block is the labour pain of all word-scribes, it just pops up once in a while.  Alex has to give thank you to the two Cubans, if they have not burnt his Apple laptop, he would not have called up a stenographer who brings in a new whiff of air and inspiration.  Change is what a writer needs when blocks so savagely build up on the way. Two storylines overlap each other, the fictional romance in the 20's is a remake or an imitation of the one in the first decade of the 21st century, of which the ending seemingly should be known and yet unknown.  Interesting is the reader (Emma) does participate in the game of the writer (Alex).  Reader-writer relationship is a prevalent struggle of the artists: should I produce a film to tell people's mind or should I make one to tell people my mind (my signature)?  A sculpture of the time or an artwork of my mind?  Many or self?  Now, the writer is fed by the reader's opinions, somehow show Rob Reiner's style: he tells people stories that they are familiar with or even have empathy with. The backdrop setting is so simple consisting of only a few scenes.  What we have the most frequently is Alex's shabby apartment.  It would be far more powerful to adapt the story into a play on stage without changing the cast.  Yet, they cannot appear on stage as Alex Sheldon + Adam Shipley plus Emma Dinsmore (+ Ylva + Elsa + Eldora + Anna) all together at the same time.  That's the worry of the playwright.  In the movie, LW and KH just have done a great job though there is not great big sparkling chemistry between them.  Good acting, in particular big round of applause for the versatile KH for she can really capture the accents of all the Europeans (various countries) when they speak American English, the German Elsa is the most fantastic! I feel a little discouraging for the Eurasian-looked Sophie Marceau who enjoys popularity ever since La Boum in France and also Asia but not Hollywood.  I gather that she is still working hard to get something more from the Tinseltown.  Anyway, her modern Polina is really more attractive than the one in 20's and she has done a great job to be the money grabbing French kitty. ""Adam Shipley had given up on love. Art was to be his mistressÂ…"" without love, man got no mistress.  And if his mistress happens to be a stenographer, she had better not lose or soak or drop his 18-page hard toil especially when there is a DEADline to meet.  If I were that man, I would make her marry me for 18 years (of hard labour).",0.0

This is the second clay spectacular from the creator of W&G, Aardman. In this it is Gromit's birthday and Wallace is out of money to pay for his bills. Wallace gets Gromit a collar (So he looks like somebody's dog now) and a pair of robotic trousers, Techno Trousers AKA the wrong trousers. And as it is taking Gromit to walkie he decides to let people stay at the house to pay off the debt that they're having and then the Penguin comes. He is not a cute, cuddly penguin he is actually a scheming penguin he plans to get rid of Gromit forever and by catching Wallace's attention he does just that. Gromit leaves for a new home and he spends a night living in the smelly garbage just as the penguin plots to use the trousers for robbery. And he takes Wallace and he climbs up the side of the museum to steal the diamond and when he gets it after he had triggered the alarm and escaped. He locks Wallace & Gromit in the cupboard with the Techno Trousers and then, after they had escaped and had a death-defying match in the kitchen which includes a train chase, a gun and a bottle, they catch him and he's locked up in the zoo till now.

66097,"Visually OK, Otherwise Weak; While the animation is quite good in spots, the film itself lacks warmth or chemistry. Much of the voice acting, particularly that of Dakota Fanning, is flat and sounds forced. While the 3D was interesting enough, several scenes felt like they'd been inserted for no other reason than to stick something in the audience's face. Example: the banana slug scene, which added nothing to either the story or character development. Parents should take note: many children under 9 or 10 in the theater in which I saw the film were scared to tears by the villain; I heard quite a few ""Mommy, I'm scared! I want to go!"" and similar complaints resulting in young children leaving the cinema. All in all, Coraline is visually nice, though not particularly noteworthy (old videos for the band Tool did better with the same sorts of material, for instance). The story is an interesting one, but this adaptation will likely leave most viewers over the age of 15 cold and those under 8 too scared to enjoy it. This is certainly nothing on par with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" and even ""The Corpse Bride"" was a stronger animated film.",0.0

38038,"Exquisitely Crafted Horror; Seeing this right after ""...Black Lagoon"" reminds me of just how stupid so many early monster features were. In contrast, this is smart, smart, smart at every turn. This time, Park has expanded and populated the W & G world; he fixes the central shortcoming of ""A Close Shave"": he has brought back the noir construction of the inventor within losing control of the machinery to a nefarious force that toys with him. Here, Park gets to incorporate ideas from film classics and gets a feature length in which to flesh it all out. He has crafted this artificial world down to the most excruciating detail, using all of the best parts of the prior three W & G shorts. The central borrowings are ""Curse of the Werewolf"", ""The Fly"" (both the original and the remake), with a hint of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". Along the way, there are plenty of clever 'Bugs Bunny' visual quotes. The climax very precisely pays homage to ""King Kong"". For most movies, it's enough to make smart use of story narrative...but Park goes the extra step of filming this world with a care we seldom see. The camera is acknowledged in every scene; it is curious, it explores from impossible perspectives; it provides the requisite degree of subtlety. Here's to hoping that all of Aardman's future projects remain so enjoyably free of Dreamworks' audience testing and industrial pressures toward mediocrity.",1.0
66097,"A stunning 3D fantasy.; Having already watched and loathed two movies based on Neil Gaiman talesÂ—Mirrormask (1/10) and Stardust (3/10)Â—I was extremely hesitant about seeing Coraline, but was ultimately lured by the promise of an extra dimension (I'm a sucker for a gimmick). And to my amazement, I loved every minute of it. The perfect viewing choice for anyone who adores dark, twisted fantasyÂ—or for parents wishing to warp their children's delicate minds (the film contains disturbing imagery guaranteed to upset kiddies of a nervous disposition)Â—Coraline is an absolute tour-de-force of exquisite story-telling, stunning 3D visuals, breathtaking animation, wonderful music, and brilliant voice-work (from a cast including Dakota Fanning, desperate housewife Teri Hatcher, and my least favourite comedy duo of all time, French and Saunders). Gaiman's freakish story follows 10-year-old Coraline, the frustrated daughter of inattentive parents, as she ventures through a mysterious hidden door in her new home that leads to a seemingly perfect alternate world, complete with extremely considerate and caring versions of her mother and father. The fact that everyone in this doppelganger dimension has buttons for eyes is a little unnerving perhaps, but Coraline doesn't mind, so long as she gets to keep her eyes. So when her new, button-eyed parents offer to keep Coraline forever, just so long as she agrees to a new pair of plastic peepers being sewn onto her head, the little girl decides that perhaps her real home isn't so bad after all. However, her alternative mother is keen to hang on to Coraline, hoping to feed off her life-force, and isn't about to let the girl go without a fight... Other bizarre and memorable characters include Wybie Lovat, Coraline's 'stalker'/friend (who helps save the day), Mr. Bobinsky, the gangly legged owner of a musical mouse circus (who provides the highlight of the film, as his talented rodents put on a spectacular show), and Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, two strange, old actresses with a collection of stuffed Highland Terriers (and whose past performances include the dubiously named 'King Leer' And 'Julius Sees-her').

8838,"Great character study; Although the story of a struggling single mother isn't what one would think of as typical for a Martin Scorsese film, there is never any doubt that's 1974's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore is 100% vintage Scorsese. His penchant for long tracking shots (including one that starts in the middle of a restaurant and ends up outside of it, meaning that the most famous shot in Goodfellas is a neat reversal of this one) is fully on display as is his tendency to whirl the camera around to create mood. Also, like most of his other early films, Scorsese is more concerned with creating convincing, interesting characters here than coming up with a conventional plot. From what I've seen, this is easily the funniest of Scorsese's early films. The humor doesn't involve unlikely scenarios or external factors the way most straight on comedy films do, though: rather it arises naturally from the unusual personalities of the characters, particularly Alice and her son. Thus the comedy actually adds to the characterizations. This film isn't only concerned with the minutiae of a single character, though. There are deeper implications in Alice's search for a new life as symbolized in her attempts to reach the town of Monterey. At some point, Alice begins to doubt this goal and this isn't shown as some silly weakness of character: rather, the possibility that a dream might be better in theory than in practice is given some play. This is the opposite of the trite convention of fictional protagonists overcoming obstacles without being changed. Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore is one film that does not adhere to the idea that compromise necessarily means the death of the spirit, or at least it questions this idea. Still, this aspect of the film has been the source of some controversy. Some critics see a strong female character questioning the possibility of realizing her dream as anti-feminist but these critics have missed the importance of Alice's independence throughout, particularly in regards to this issue. I think it's a shame that Scorsese is mostly known for less subtle, overtly violent films like Goodfellas and The Departed; for me, his style seems to mesh better with lower key films like this one. Still, his studies of abnormal characters (i.e. Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy) are also very effective; it's only when Scorsese attempts to focus on something other than a character study that the films suffer a drop in quality.",0.0

Although, Bakshi's films, as far as story quality, are much darker, and often dramatic while Les Triplettes of Bellville is obviously a light-hearted comedy. The movie centers around the Tour de France. Our main character is pretty much Madame Souza, grandmother of a bicycle champion. She's a lovable little character, an incredibly short, stout woman with orthopedic shoes and a lazy eye. It's quite comical to watch her ride on a tricycle around town blowing her whistle as she trains her grandson for the race. He, who is not at all an appealing character to look at, with his large nose and face like a sullen animal, a waste like Aeon Flux, and huge leg muscles. He never speaks, and rarely expresses emotion. A to the mix, a fat female dog (I thought it was a pregnant dog the way it was always fretting) with little chicken legs named Bruno, who shares in the adventures. (I love their little three story house, with the train track built as close to it as possible just short of knocking the damn structure over). While at the Tour de France, Madam Souza and another guy's car is sabotaged by some suits in the French mafia. These are two of the most bizarre characters I've ever seen, with large boxy suits of matte black. When they stand next to each other, they look like Siamese twins, and they tend to blend in a lot. They're headed by a short fat guy with a large know looks like a French Super Mario. They kidnap some of the racers who straggled behind, and absconded to Bellville, where they intend to use them for sport--stationary bike racing, which I suppose is a more sophisticated alternative to the poor European working-class's cock fighting (just say no!) and bare knuckle boxing. Madam Souza and Bruno the trusty hound have only minimal clues of the whereabouts of her grandson, only knowing that he is somewhere in Belleville. And that's where our lovely Tripplettes enter the picture. Classic French burlesque singers they were in the past, but now the three aging singers live in an old apartment building somewhere in the slums (though they don't make it very 'slumming' on the inside) on the outskirts of Bellville. They befriend little Madam Souza and Bruno, and eventually, help her in her adventure to save her grandson from the grips of the French mob. I absolutely love the chase scene at the end because it seems like they used the most comical way to stop their mobster adversaries from catching up to them. It was fantastic! I absolutely recommend 'Les Triplettes de Belleville.' If you're of an American audience like me, you'll probably be grateful for something so fresh and new to come around within recent years (Hollywood produces an awful lot of trash and sometimes, independent makers do too). I love the music (those Triplettes can practically play downbeat and they can make an instrument with nearly anything they've got), the weird animation (look at the French waiter for example, or the little rat-faced henchmen, and the stupid boyscout), and the great times that Madam Souza, Bruno, and the Triplettes share. It's a great movie all around. And the perfect part is that there is no real dialogue to screw any of that up. If you watch the DVD version, which is beautiful, you get the option of the Belleville Rendez-vous music video, which is incredibly strange, but nonetheless, has quite an interesting technique that pays homage to silent era black and white movies. It's so goofy! So have yourself a rendez-vous with Madam Souza, Bruno, and the Triplettes of Belleville!",0.027777777777777776
6773,"Funny and wonderfully, playfully weird-Son Fantastique!; The animation in ""Triplettes"" is clearly the work of brilliant consortium. The drawn art work layers smoothly and adds to the visual spectacle with strong images while not jolting the audience. The story is simple but the characters are surreal. The tone a is mixture of the best dry continental tongue in cheek humor, slapstick gags and visual absurdity. We see the resolve of a grandmother (who must be near a hundred years old) to free her kidnapped grandson. The dreams of a dog fixated on trains are revealed to us and well as the memories of the retired scat singing Triplettes. Frogs are blown into the air as well as the gangsters who seem to come most commonly in snap-together sets of three. I mentioned that the story-line is simple; indeed it is so simple to follow that subtitles are not needed. The action flows in clear visual strings of information that a few words of French here and there need no translation. The above being said, WHY did Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment think it fit to issue the DVD with out even the option of watching this great film in its original form? You can watch the DVD in English or Spanish, nothing else! I am insulted and angry by this travesty. If they really believe that the American movie watching public is such a bunch of Ya-Hoos they can't figure out how to set the language of a DVD then maybe they should get out of the US foreign film market. Specialize in monster-truck films or something but leave the fine work of movies like this, if not alone, then at least available as an option. The DVD was a disappointment and left a very bad taste in my mouth.",0.027777777777777776
66097,"A Different Kind of Rabbit Hole; It was just yesterday when no one would've imagined an animation studio going toe-to-toe with the reigning heavyweight champion known as Pixar, but the creative minds at Laika studios have done just that. Coraline, which arrived on DVD and Blu-ray this past July, is a work of art from top to bottom. It's a real shame that it's taken me so long to sit down and review the film, but, at long last, I was able to devote an afternoon to taking in what can only be described as a truly exquisite feature. The story follows a young girl by the name ofÂ—you guessed itÂ—Coraline. She's just moved from Michigan to Oregon, and isn't at all happy about having left her friends and the life she knew. This should sound instantly familiar to most moviegoers, as being displaced from a familiar locale is often used as a catalyst for unrest by many writers (it's the whole ""fish out of water"" mechanism). What's especially relevant about Coraline's situation, however, is that she comes from the Motor City; her family has been forced to move because of the economy, and that's something many people can relate to. Symbolism is pops up in more tangible forms too; namely in the form of Wybie Lovat (""Wybie"" is short for ""Whyborn,"" which aptly accentuates the disconnect Coraline feels from her parents, who are constantly working in an effort to pay the bills). What makes Coraline so effective, though, is its perception of a child's imagination. As Coraline explores her early 20th century apartment home, she takes pleasure in the rusty water heater, the leaky windows, and an inexplicably small door cut into the living room wall. Beyond this door is a world that caters to all of Coraline's desires, and she discovers this through a series of ""dreams."" In this ""bizarro world"" she encounters her ""other"" family, who have buttons for eyes and pay her all of the attention she could ever want. The design of this colorful playground is reminiscent of a Disney/Burton hybrid: it's at once startlingly beautiful, but warped (and borderline Gothic) in its undertones. As the illusion of the ""other"" world existing only as a dream is dissolved, Coraline quickly becomes immersed in a very dangerous situation. In fact, I could easily see this freaking out very young viewers. It's rated PG, but there are times when the creepiness abounds and the proceedings approach horror film territory. But let me return to the beauty of the animation. For the most part it's extremely fluid, and rarely does the realization that it's all stop-motion result in a distraction. One of the best ways to describe much of the art design is to imagine a Van Gogh painting (and, toward the film's conclusion, the echoes of The Starry Night are impossible to ignore). The smooth animation combined with the stark contrast between the gray ""real"" world and the colorful ""other"" world is mesmerizing, and I can't see a youngsterÂ—or an adult, for that matterÂ—being able to look away. I watched it as a 2D Blu-ray, although it did give me the option for 3D. From one of the very beginning, in fact, it's clear that this was a movie made for 3D: a sewing needle remains motionless in front of the camera for a good 3-4 seconds, suggesting that an ""in-your-face"" effect was the intent. This, combined with a relatively tidy conclusion, dampens what would be an otherwise unforgettable film. Still, it's more than worth your time, especially if you have children. Sit back, relax, and marvel in the beauty of what director Henry Selick has created. Just don't be surprised if said child wants to sleep with the light on afterward (you know, just in case).",0.0
1080,"Sharp, Ballsy Satire is Often Undeservedly Overlooked; If the story of Christianity's roots is eternal, so too should be anyone brave enough to parody it. This, the British troupe's second cinematic expedition, is neither as carelessly silly as ""The Holy Grail"" nor as manic and sketch-heavy as ""The Meaning of Life,"" but it's every bit as funny in its own dryly sarcastic way. Though it might not be as immediately gratifying as its peers, I've come to appreciate ""Brian"" as the Pythons' best-written picture over the years, with a razor-sharp wit playing excellently alongside the requisite amounts of lunacy and brow-furrowing topics of conversation. And, though it's clearly a product of the late '70s in many ways, its not-so-subtle warnings against blind faith in any organization (or the men at the helm) is still very relevant in today's world. It isn't the non-stop jaunt through the funhouse that you might expect from this cast, yet ""Brian"" delivers no less efficiently in different ways, especially during its hilariously bleak song and dance finale.",0.0

I was a little sad that the ending wasn't a bit different but I won't spoil it for those who haven't watched yet. The voices of the characters matched up very well with the characters. The plot was also very unique. It reminded me a little of I, Robot but was a much better film and was directed in a much better fashion. The animation was so good there were a number of scenes in the movie that could be made into movie posters if you know what I mean. I recommend you see this no matter what age you are! I'm surprised that it took me so long to see this movie. It is also important to note the good soundtrack. It fit the scenes well and added to the suspense of a number of scenes.",0.0
71057,"9 Movie Review from The Massie Twins; It would be easy to dismiss 9 as simply an instance of visual artistry masking an underwhelming post-apocalyptic story; but upon closer inspection, the plot actually only suffers from too many ideas for the truncated runtime. Many of the concepts are clever and new and the elaborate action sequences provide the thrills, though the setting and man vs. machine apocalypse have seen more than their share of incarnations. But what the story lacks in expected profoundness, the generally impressive visual designs more than make up for. All nine ""stitchpunk"" protagonists are memorable and easily distinguishable (the variety of celebrity voices don't hurt), and the enemy machines possess all manner of sharp weaponry and enormous statures. Perhaps the focus on action over origins keeps the excitement from fading, but for a world so full of possibilities, it seems like the answers should have been as exhilarating as the explosions. ""Stitchpunk"" creation 9 (Elijah Wood) awakens to a desolate world ravaged by war. Full of questions, he ventures forth and encounters 2 (Martin Landau), a being like himself, only less complex in design. But before he can learn much about his surroundings or his past, his newfound friend is captured by a gargantuan metal beast and dragged away to a mysterious factory. 9 soon discovers more stitched beings, including the one-eyed 5 (John C. Reilly), the cryptic 6 (Crispin Glover), the battle adept 7 (Jennifer Connelly), the brutish 8 (Fred Tatasciore), the mute twins 3 and 4, and their ominous leader 1 (Christopher Plummer), who rules the group with fear and paranoia. In a hasty attempt to rescue 2, 9 accidentally activates a terrible creation, and must now lead the group on a perilous mission to uncover the secrets of the past in order to save their future. The blind pursuit of technology brought humankind closer to doom, leaving in its wake the charred remains of civilization and the arrival of tiny, intellectual patchwork puppets. With little more than a couple of sentences to explain the vast, frightening, ""Terminator 2"" post-apocalyptic world, 9 jumps right into the mystery and wonder of deciphering a new existence and fending off mortifying, robotic creatures. Gathering clues about these strange critters and learning about their purpose is half the fun, although with a short runtime and way too much to clarify, the plot suffers from abrupt solutions. The introduction of a mystical talisman, for example, provides a rather unlikely and vague explication for the formidable predicaments. As with most futuristic and science-fiction films, the setup often requires so much background that either it's left obscure or it envelopes the entire movie. With 9, the setting is dwarfed by the visuals, focusing almost entirely on incredibly creative designs and taught action sequences. The environment is beautiful in its daunting desolation, and the enemies are wickedly crafted from mercilessly sharp, rusty and jagged metal scraps. The nine sack dolls are also inventively pieced together with the oddments of the shattered human race (the remnants of steampunk), and like The Magnificent 9, each serves a unique mental and physical purpose. With fascinating, abrasive visuals, a PG-13 rating and a few scares that are quite intense for younger audiences, 9 confirms the birth of a notably adult computer animated feature. - The Massie Twins",0.0
38038,"Austin Movie Show review; Even before the film begins, you get the added treat of enjoying a 10-minute short film starring the ""Penguins"" from Madagascar. It's nothing spectacular, but it's cute. The real magic, however, starts with the opening credits of Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. The clay-mation is superb and the story is absolutely enchanting. It reminded me of the old stop-motion and clay-mation Christmas movies that I adored as a kid. In the film, Wallace and his faithful dog Gromit are best-control agents who protect their clients' vegetable gardens from pesky rabbits. But they're not exterminators. They humanely deal with animals, never harming a single varmint. Wallace, the savvy inventor that he is, connects his brain with that of a rabbit in an effort to ""rehabilitate"" the rabbit and keep it from eating other people's vegetables. In the process, they switch brains, and the were-rabbit is born. Now it's up to Wallace and Gromit to save the village vegetable show from a giant and savage rabbit. Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is simply too cute for words. It was never dull and even funnier than I expected. I may have enjoyed it, but the kids in the theater were having the time of their lives!",1.0
6493,"Above Average Romantic Comedy; This fun, entertaining romance comedy adds special fantasy scenarios and uses cute past historical romance with current day playwriting uses characters past and present.

Gene Hackman is excellent as a ""maverick"" style FBI man, complementing Dafoe's ""by the book"" character. The whole KKK portrayal is quite disturbing and there is an authentic feel to the whole community, from secret drinking dens to the segregation in the seating in the local restaurant. The part in the movie where they are asking the local people what they think has happened to the three missing boys is also very effective.

4326,"It helps to be wise in the ways and mores of Dixie; It's now a well documented fact that FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was convinced that the Civil Rights movement was somehow being directed from Moscow as part of the Communist conspiracy. As if anyone's struggle for equality needed outside direction. Hoover's bugging of Martin Luther King is legendary both for its lack of useful information to prove that thesis and for the titillation that King's indiscretions provided for certain people in power courtesy of J. Edgar. But when the murders of those two outside civil rights workers from New York City Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman happened the nation was shocked. First it was a missing persons case, then a homicide when the bodies were discovered. Public opinion forced the FBI and its director to take this seriously. And I have to say that when they did, the job was done. The names of the civil rights workers were not mentioned nor was the name of the young black kid who here was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. In real life James Morton was a voter registrar working with Goodman and Schwerner. That gave some dramatic license to the producers of Mississippi Burning to spin their own version of events. Given the redneck wall of silence that federal investigators had to deal with I'm not sure the spinning was too far from the truth. Willem Dafoe's portrayal of a button down FBI agent of the Hoover era rings real true. Hoover's own standards regarding appearance and behavior of his agents somewhat hampered law enforcement in certain fields. He had other foibles that have come down to us since his death in 1972, some real, some speculative. Dafoe just isn't getting the job done. Which brings us to Gene Hackman who is a former Mississippi sheriff and wise in the ways and mores of Dixie. When Dafoe gives him a free hand Hackman gets results even though like in real life these Ku Klux Klansmen could only be tried in federal court as no Mississippi state jury would have convicted these creatures. Hackman got a well deserved Oscar nomination for his performance. And it's a good thing that the ACLU wasn't looking to hard at Hackman's methods. It was like what Sean Connery taught Kevin Costner about bringing down Al Capone in The Untouchables. It probably did take the FBI bending Hoover's precious rules to get justice in real life. Frances McDormand plays a truly sad role as the wife of one of the sheriff's deputies who was in on the killing. She's a caring and compassionate woman and indiscreet about her husband's activities. She pays for that. It is restrained, understated, but very powerful performance that netted her a Best Supporting Actress nomination. Mississippi Burning won for Best Cinematography and got a number of other nominations including Best Picture. Sad to say it was up against Rain Man that year and I'd hate to split the difference between what Hackman and what Dustin Hoffman did in his classic. It's ironic that I saw this film and between seeing it and writing about it I attended one of many marriage equality rallies throughout the nation as the Supreme Court hears arguments about same sex marriage. The same people who could not comprehend the mixing of races are in the forefront of a fight against marriage equality because their minds can't comprehend that either. A seismic cultural shift against racial segregation took place just as a seismic cultural shift is occurring now toward the acceptance of the LGBT lives and lifestyles. It's been a privilege to live in these interesting times. Mississippi Burning with a bit of literary license remains a fine dramatic film and should be required viewing for those who want to study those times and get an idea what the civil rights struggle was about. Books will not give you as good an idea as Mississippi Burning will.",0.0

With a little help from Shaun, Wallace must rescue Gromit and catch the real crooks. There are more laughs and jokes in this half-hour short than most feature-length comedies manage in their entire running time. Nearly every frame has some kind of wit or imagination. The world of Wallace and Gromit, much like the stop-motion world of Postman Pat, is an incongruous mix of post-war Northern countryside crossed with sci-fi and a touch of horror.

1175,"Imaginative, funny and insane (its French...); This is possible one of the most orginal, imaginative and hilarous films I've ever seen. Considering this was made in 1991 that is some feat. It is based in a post-apoclaptic (sp.) world where food is in short supply and a butcher kills off people to feed the residents in his building, picking off the unlucky newcomers or those to old. This is the basis for the black-comic mayhem which follows. Picks of the film: the finale (bathroom scene) and abstract suicide attempts by a female resident. Suicide attempt one: She sits in the bath (with her clothes on) and with a sewing machine to one side of her with a piece of red cloth on. The red cloth stretches across the bath with a light on top of it turned on. The sewing machine is connected up the door buzzer. She invites a bloke around.......meanwhile next door the clown (employed in maintenance) is fixing a bed. The bloke rings the door several times the light gets closer to falling...the clown hits the bed net door and plug comes out just as the light falls in.

My Cousin Vinny turned into a very intelligent and great comedic story. It's about two boys who have been accused of murder, with a lot of pressing evidence against them that can get them executed, but one of the boy's cousins, Vinny, is a lawyer, well, just graduated and starting his first six weeks. Not to mention, he's never fought a trial or murder case. Vinny has also brought along his Brooklyn talking fiancÃ©e, Mona Lisa Vito. With little experience and getting into a web of lies, Vinny must learn that good arguing is not just what will help, but he also has to learn how to be a lawyer. Joe and Marissa absolutely steal the show. I think my favorite part was when Mona Lisa was on the stand talking about which cars were involved in the murder case, she just got into a fight with Vinny and she refuses to help him, but she does and he kisses her hand and you can tell they made up, but it's just their looks that are just plain priceless!

4326,"The Best Film of 1988; Great movies are ones that invoke a strong emotional response that lingers long after the movie is over. Mississippi Burning is that kind of film. You may love it, you  may hate it. You may think that it is an accurate depiction of the south in 1964, you may think its pure fiction. No matter what you will respond strongly. Director Alan Parker has been down this road before with Midnight Express, another crushing, gut-wrenching tale based on a true story. In both cases, a great deal of liberty is taken with the facts, but that doesn't matter. Mississippi Burning is not a docudrama or an A & E special, it is at its heart, a police drama, and a near perfect one at that. It is criticized by some for its depiction of southerners of the time as a group of brain-dead racists with no moral fiber whatsoever. I don't believe that is the movie's intention, but it spends time showing this side of society to make us understand how hate breeds itself, and how it becomes a way of life and an accepted standard. As one character states, ""When we were seven years old, they told us that segregation was in the bible. You hear that long enough, you start to believe it"". Mississippi Burning won a (well-deserved) Oscar for cinematography, but sat and watched Rain Main take home the majors. It was clearly the best film of 1988 and stands as one of the great works of American cinema of the 80's. Hackman and Dafoe are at their best, and Frances McDormand delivers a beautifully understated, powerful performance as the deputy's wife - a woman at war with her sense of right and wrong, struggling with fear and loyalty. Her character is the centerpiece of the movie. This is not a preachy or melodramatic movie. You won't get a lecture on why racism is wrong. You will get an rich, engaging crime drama depicting a pivotal time in American History, and you will never forget it. **** out of ****.",0.0

A phenomenal cast includes master thespian Sir Lawrence Olivier, veteran Maggie Smith, Rocky's hard-boiled Burgess Meredith, a young Harry Hamlin, and extrordinarily beautiful Judi Bowker.

19,Horrible; This was an absolutely horrendous movie full of bathroom humor that is aimed at getting a cheap laugh.  The only reason that this movie was made was because of the theory that if a movie makes a big splash and becomes a big time hit then a sequel will also be a big hit.  Often times that is not the case and this movie is one of those.   The first Ace Ventura had a lot of the same bathroom humor and slapstick humor but it went about it in a more tasteful way.

5540,"CGI is for cowards!; This movie has been a favorite of mine since i was a kid--i was very into Greek mythology during grade school, so i loved this film, even though i've seen it about two dozen times (it continues to be a Sunday-afternoon staple on TV). There are a number of mythological inaccuracies in this film (the Kraken wasn't a mythological monster; Perseus didn't have Pegasus, but actually borrowed Hermes' winged sandals, etc.), but it's still a good kids' introduction to ancient mythology. While the actors playing the ""mortals"" are definitely inferior to those playing the Gods, i suppose it works in the sense of their being the Olympians' puppets and, well, a little limpness in the thespian department is somewhat de rigeur (as is the wise/comic sidekick of Burgess Meredith and the 'little and cute' factor of the mechanical owl) for the kind of classic matinee swashbuckler that ""Clash of the Titans"" is. But all these complaints that the Harryhausen effects are crap and it would be so much better done with CGI... well, that's pure craziness. Sure, the monsters don't look convincing, but they look a hell of a lot more convincing then they would as cheap computer animation--can you honestly imagine the Medusa sequence being done any better with some cartoon computer program? (Why? So it could look like the crap in ""Phantom Menace""?) I've always felt that Harryhausen's stop-motion technique and the resultant odd way in which the monsters moved added to the sense of their mythic status, their unreality, the sense that these are creatures from another world, another plane. (The recent Asian fantasy/action film ""Onmyoji"" paid tribute to the master by having a CGI demon army move in Harryhausen stop-motion style and damn me if they didn't look scarier, more unearthly for it.) In my opinion, CGI looks even less ""real,"" more like a painted-on cartoon. There's a depth and detail to creatures that have actually been created in the three-dimensional real world that those who have only existed on a computer screen don't have. Also, no matter how good an actor is, there's a difference between someone who's in the same room with the monster he's fighting, or who at least knows what it looks like, and someone who's just trying to ""act scared"" in the general direction where something will be inserted later. (Imagine the ""Alien"" movies made with a hyped-up animated creature: you know that even motionless and plastic squeezed between light stands, that giant H.R. Geiger monster gave everyone on set the creeps.) Maybe people like CGI because they feel safer with obviously fake monsters, things that never even existed as a three-foot high model next to the ham sandwich in someone's shop.",0.0

Short money means they may not be able to afford competent legal representation...but...ta-da...Cousin Vinny is a family member who is a lawyer, and comes to the rescue. Only thing is...he's only been practicing for six weeks, and has only done personal injury. Plus, his big city ways clash with this backwards , sleepy, southern town. The main point of the movie is how Pesci keeps a step ahead of the game with lies, mis-statements, mis-representations...and a a girlfriend in Marisa Tomei, who is not only a sexpot...she's smarter than he is. Especially about cars. He gives Judge Fred Gwynne (in his final film) apoplexy...and Gwynne gives him time for contempt. Finally, Vinny gets his legal legs and decides to face this thing directly...just like a full fledged criminal lawyer...though he's NEVER tried a case before...not even personal injury. You know it's got to be hilarious, and the joke is on Pesci, even though he manages to fool everyone. Intelligently funny without going over the top completely, this is a film you will want to watch more than once and possibly...like me...you will want to add it to your film collection.",0.0
71057,"It is extremely difficult to recommend this for anything other than its terrific visuals and art direction; 9 was originally a short film directed by Shane Acker, in which the main characters did not speak. Acker's feature film, which was produced by Tim Burton, expands on his original work and is set in an alternate universe, presumably after the First World War. Before he died, a scientist developed tiny mechanical androids that were created in representing parts of his personality and each was given a number. 9 (Elijah Wood) awakens one day to find a powerful glowing talisman and he is chased by a giant spider-like robot. 9 is saved by fellow android 2, but his rescuer is then captured by the beast. 9 is taken in by a number of other androids who are also tagged with numbers, including 1 (Christopher Plummer), a cranky, elderly android, dressed like a bishop. Against the wishes of 1, 9 with the help of 5 (John C. Reilly), ventures across the battlefields to rescue 2 but in doing so, he unleashes something more dangerous. In a year of outstanding animated pictures, from Pixar's touching adventure Up to the hilarity of Mary and Max, a film like 9 really fails to standout. This is not an original or exciting film but rather a highly generic action adventure, light on story, characterisation and development. At a mere 79 minutes the film never has a chance to really develop itself into anything substantial. Yet at the same time, given the lack of intensity and originality with the action, the brevity of the film is actually rather welcoming. One aspect in which the film does excel though is in its visuals and art design. The desolate wastelands are wonderfully detailed with debris and rubble to echo both past and current warfare. The giant spider robots too are a hideously fierce opponent and quite an awesome sight, adding to the grand spectacle. They would probably be far too scary for younger viewers though as this is a much darker film than a lot of other animated pictures in both its aesthetics and its tone. Given the talent in the voice cast, from Elijah Wood, John C. Reilly, Jennifer Connelly and Christopher Plummer, it is a shame that the film's script is so lacking in both originality and depth. The story amounts to little more than a very standard adventure film that is unconcerned about exploring or developing its characters in a particularly thoughtful way. The voice actors are largely wasted because of the stilted and generic dialogue that thoroughly limits our interest and emotional attachment to them. 1 is perhaps the most interesting character because of his cruelty and his antagonism towards technology. The rest of the characters though are utterly bland and any form of character development is both formulaic and predictable. The world too that Acker has visually defined becomes a fairly hollow one, with little insights. The most interesting aspect of the world, the allusions to the First World War, are limited to flashbacks with glimpses of mustard gas and the battle between man and machines. The killer robots are a relatively obvious metaphor for the introduction of armoured tanks in warfare. As with the rest of the film though, these elements are of the simplest form, never reaching any intellectual or emotional depths. Only the sight of a cathedral burning up in flames as it reflects in the eyes of 1 is a particularly memorable image. 9 is a film that fails to be memorable or particularly enjoyable because amidst so many cleverer and inventive animated pictures, this feels incredibly lazy and generic with its storytelling and narrative. It fails to make us feel or care and becomes a brief and ultimately passive experience. With more effort towards the screenplay and more attention paid to the back-story and character arches, this could have been a reasonable film. Currently though, it is extremely difficult to recommend this for anything other than its terrific visuals and art direction.",0.0
50005,"Outstanding visuals; confusing & ultimately boring picture; The first thing you notice about this picture, and the thing that stays with you long after final credits, is the visuals. Intense colors, beautifully framed scenes, stunning opulence -- all leads to breath-taking beauty. Now we know where the budget was allocated. The plot was so subtle as to be non-existent in parts. I ended up watching it dubbed *and* with subtitles in order to try to figure out what was going on. And discovered that the dubbed translation differed from the subtitles in several critical places, leaving me more confused. Gong Li is riveting as the empress, giving layer upon layer of dimension to an essentially cardboard cutout role. Jin Chen is fabulous in her minor but critical role. Chow Yun-Fat is wasted as the controlling emperor. The other actors' performances were so thin that I had difficulty telling them apart, even though they looked very different from each other. As others have noted, I was strongly reminded of The Lion In Winter while watching this, which made watching this that much worse. Yes, it included a twisted, dysfunctional family whose fate is determined by the titanic contest of wills between husband and wife, but these paled in comparison to the intensity of the story and acting of Lion In Winter. Ultimately I was bored by the picture. It's not a martial arts film. It's a film with some martial arts sequences -- just like any drama that has a few scenes of violence. Regrettably, this drama lacked coherence and any kind of compelling narrative. Perhaps it has layers of meaning evident to native Chinese. I certainly couldn't get into it, and ended up fast- forwarding thru The Big Battle and some of the Long Emotional Shots just so I could get to the end.",0.0
5540,"Great Film; For years my favourite Ray Harryhausen movie was 'The Golden Voyage Of Sinbad' but as I've got older 'Clash Of The Titans' has slowly replaced it. For a start it's a lot darker in tone - unworthy suitors to the Princess Andromeda being burnt, Andromeda herself having to be sacrificed to the Kracken and Medusa getting her head sliced off (Medusa also being a nightmarish creation). The film censors in the UK originally gave this film a 15 certificate - possibly for 2 sequence's that show brief nudity (Each time I've seen this film on TV they always cut these scenes but then again they usually keep showing it on Sunday afternoons!) The story is interesting - The bit on the isle of the Dead is fantastic as is the final 10 minutes - and papers over any cracks in some of the acting although I personally think Harry Hamlin does OK. Burgess Merideth fits his part perfectly and Olivier as Zeus commands the respect the role needs. The special effects by Ray Harryhausen are obviously not as good as what can be done today using computers and CGI but I think that because it was all done by stop motion it adds to the charm - indeed this was probably one of the last films to fully use this technique and any way - the effects in this film are far better than Harryhausen/Schneers previous movie 'Sinbad And The Eye Of The Tiger' (which unlike this film has a lot of padding). I like this film a lot - it's a great way to waste a few hours and there's also another reason I love this film... When Perseus first enters the city and sees the burning body of Andromedas last unsuccessful suitor he is told by a guard that men are willing to sacrifice themselves just to have a kingdom to rule over - Sod that!!- just getting Andromeda in the sack would be enough for me.. Judi Bowker is absolutely, heart stopping- drop dead Stunning. 9/10",0.0

With Joe Pesci in the cast I was looking for some snappy banter and terrific one liners but I'm still waiting. As the two mistaken identity criminals, Ralph Macchio and Mitchell Whitfield seemed relatively lifeless; their situation could have been played up for more laughs as well. And when I read some other viewer reviews and learned that Marisa Tomei received a Best Supporting Oscar for this, I had to go and check. Not that she wasn't competent for what the script called for, but Oscar worthy? Come on. Probably the cleverest bit to come out of this picture was the name of the town where all these folks were stranded, somehow fitting that it all came down to the old Wahzoo.",0.0

5214,"extraordinary. historic, un-appreciated; Someone, I cannot remember who, once said to ""watch for those who live long, for they have also lived well, and we can learn from them."" George Burns lived to be 100 years old. A small man of slight stature, he left a mark on the entertainment business that few have equalled -- with successful careers in vaudeville, radio, TV and film. Not to mention a marriage (and love affair with his wife) that will stand for the ages. Even now, there are still those who will buy a pair of lovebirds at the pet shop and name them ""George and Gracie."" Speaking of film, he was 81 years young when Larry Gelbart's script was offered to him and there was no way he could turn down the role of a lifetime. Which was a blessing (pun intended) to movie-goers everywhere. (Historical Note: I am only aware of two actors who were ever asked to play God -- literally -- and those are Burns and Alanis Morrissette in Dogma. The latter was more of a walk-on and not a speaking part.) The movie? A gem, a jewel and nearly perfect. Everyone should own the DVD. Casting to die for. Aside from Burns -- who is pitch perfect as a God who simply wants his creations to do the right thing -- there is Terri Garr (who did not do enough film work!) and John Denver, a man who was born for the part of God's messenger. Gelbart gave a script to die for. Listen to God apologize for the Avocado and the Giraffe. Listen to God explain why he is very knowledgeable on the present (and ""big"" on the past) but the future is a mystery. Brilliant and timeless. Recommended.",0.0
71057,"9 is a 5; The world of '9' is better realised than its story and its characters, but even then I had a niggle that isn't really the fault of the movie - it feels like a stop motion film that hasn't been made in stop motion. The textures of the little figures that make up the cast seem suited to the medium but the somewhat rubbery, computer-animated style used instead is inappropriately slick. The movie has other, more pressing problems, but the animation didn't really work for me. Anyway, the setting - a post-war landscape in which the only survivors are the aforementioned dolls and various mechanical monsters - has an impressively doom-laden atmosphere, the highlight being a newsreel that fills in the details of mankind's destruction. It is a little odd that there aren't more bodies scattered about, but it's an intriguing environment to explore and the action sequences make inventive use of the dolls' surroundings. The creepy, spidery designs of the robots will be nightmare fuel for kids, and the dolls, all hemp-covered armatures, each with a number, are an interesting visual - they're what made me want to watch the movie. Unfortunately, the design of the characters is where any interest in them ends. Each of them has a basic characteristic and very little personality beyond a survival instinct, which makes it difficult to care about them. Nine is naÃ¯ve, Six is crazy, One is a zealot, and other than one predictable turnaround bluntly signalled early in the movie, they stay that way. It's no coincidence that the movie goes downhill once the characters start talking; they're one-dimensional and kind of irritating. The structure of the movie is equally thin, consisting of one attack after another, which quickly becomes boring. I haven't seen the short film on which this is based but the idea seems more suited to something that's eleven minutes long.",0.0

71057,"Unique, And Often Thought Provoking; 9 is not a casual film. This isn't the kind of movie where you invite a bunch of friends over, expecting an ""awesome"" movie. That's not to say it's a bad movie, it's quite good in fact. It's just not a typical film. It's bleak, it's eerie, and even the action, though strong, has a lot of symbolic meaning. I don't often watch films like 9, nor do I want to. 9 offers only a few smiles, and no laughs. Rule #1 for me, it has to have humor. I don't mind serious films, but a little humor can go a long way in helping me remember the film, and enjoy it. 9 manages to entertain without laughs. But 9 has a lot of emotion anyway. Fear certainly comes to mind, as does sadness. The PG-13 rating was not earned from language or sexual content. Part of it comes from the bloodless, yet intense violence. The more protruding part comes from the darkness. Despite it's limited inappropriate content, this is not a film for kids. It's dark themes may even challenge older ones. The story isn't all that sophisticated, to be honest. And there's more than a few clichÃ©s. There are plot points we've seen before, and characters that may evoke a sense of deja vu. But that's okay, because the movie is strong. The animation is incredible. The musical score, though a little run of the mill, is appropriately creepy, and it knows when to keep quiet. The voice cast is filled with stars that shine, but don't distract. Of course, you didn't come to see any of that. Depending on who you are, you came for one of two things; an intellectual film, and thought provoking themes, or epic machine vs. rag doll fights. If action is what you came for, you shouldn't be disappointed. There are plenty of, I shouldn't say duels, but fights between the stitch dolls, and the mechanical beasts. This film is not made up of action throughout, so teens coming ONLY for the action will surely be disappointed, but there's enough action to thrill and excite. If you came for intellectual stimulation, you will have to wait for after the film to enjoy that bit. During the movie, you will have to do little thinking. This is the kind of flick that inspires conversation after viewing. As the film runs, you simply have to sit back and enjoy. 9 is a wonderful movie. It's by no means, one for the ages, but it's a thought-provoking, heart pounding little flick, that can surely be enjoyed by any one who wants to try something, a little new.",0.0

The previews are representative of the whole. That leads into the fact this was visually creative and wonderful. The animation and overall scene direction definitely carry this movie, I recommend seeing in a theater or with a large HD TV. The characters were a little flat. Once you learn their purpose you look back and think there could have been a few more scenes to flesh them out. You shouldn't be confused though, an adult with some experience with alternate history and sci-fi won't even be surprised. A child might need a little explanation. Same with the storyline: it took a while to get to the crux, kids might need a bit of help, but it was all there and understandable. It's a little weak, but the purpose of this film was the ""look"".

1223,"Simple, sweet and funny- our introduction to Britain's favourite duo.; A Grand Day Out originally aired in 1989 at the Bristol Animation Festival and later broadcast on Christmas Eve in 1990. After 8 years of production Nick Park introduces us in this short, but sweet film to the now legendary characters of Wallace and Gromit. What Park accomplished within a 23 minute run time and using nothing more than a camera a pile of Plasticine is nothing short of astounding. In the short, Wallace and Gromit decide to take a trip to the moon after they run out of cheese to bring back to Earth, after they become bored during a Bank Holiday (this is based on an old folklore tale that the moon is made of cheese.) While there they meet an old rusted gas cooker that initially attempts to see them off before having a rather humorous dream of becoming a skier. Despite the character models and sets not being as refined as the follow-up shorts 'The Wrong Trousers' and 'A Close Shave' also not particularly having a complex or well developed plot. A Grand Day Out is still to this day is a brilliant work of art. With a simplistic, but stylish design and plot, some humorous and witty moments for both kids and adults to enjoy and more importantly packed with plenty of charm as well as a pleasing and satisfying finale. A Grand Day Out is a bold statement to how much of an impact a simple stop-motion clay animation short has on the world of film. 8/10",1.0
5540,"Nothing impressive and no excuse I could think of; It may have looked OK in an alternate reality where Star Wars and Alien did not happen, but 3 or 4 years after episode IV and 2 years after the 8th passenger, these jerky stop-motion scenes were not an excuse for a movie anymore. Plus you can find movies of the same era with far, far better effects stop motion scenes: krull, the dark crystal, never-ending story. Even the saber-toting robots of starcrash :) - not even speaking of the snow creatures in star wars V. I don't blame the special effect guys, rather the script writer who obviously failed to take into account - or thought he could cope with - the technical limitations. Look at Krull for instance, they did use stop motion with a spider in its web, and the result was very good. Now try the same with flying horses or vultures and you get nothing but jerky puppets unable to blend with the background as a result. Back in 1963 it was a revolution in special effect when they blended actors and puppets into the same pictures in Jason and the argonauts. Looks like 20 years were not enough to solve the gamma correction problem, and frankly better show the puppets and the actors in different frames than have a brightly lit guy over a blue screen blend with a jerky two-headed wolf that looks like it was filmed under the moonlight. Now for the plot. Unfortunately the movie is built around the special effects. Would it have had some decent story to tell, I wouldn't have minded so much the poor visuals. I could even have forgiven the blatant R2D2 rip-off for the owl (I wonder if Lucas sued them for that?). Mythology-wise, they seemingly picked their way through a reader's digest selection of various myths, with the Macbeth witches and the kraken as guest stars. OK, so we've got bad pictures and a bad plot so far. The actors maybe? Well this bunch of pretty famous people sure must have had a lot of bills to pay, for judging from the heart they put into their roles it's not out of love for the script they played in this movie. At least Andromeda is quite pretty, including when she cries - a good thing since she does that a lot. But was the showing of her breasts and buttocks an attempt to make the movie worth viewing for teenagers? To sum it up, this movie was a complete disappointment. I give it a 3 for the Andromeda cutie and the funny old geezer that accompanies the rather bland hero through this uninspiring quest. I would advise to watch the original Jason and the argonauts instead, it is far better.",0.0

2302,"Road Trip Meets Law and Order Meets Fish Out of Water Comedy That Works!; My Cousin Vinny is the improbable but entertaining movie about two college grads who, after road tripping through the South, end up mistakenly arrested for the murder of a convenience store clerk in Alabama. Ralph Macchio (still looking like a pretty boyish 30-year- old) and Mitchell Whitfield (later Rachel's ex-fiancÃ© Barry on Friends) play the grads who call on Macchio's character's cousin to use his newly-minted law degree to help them out. Here enters Joe Pesci as Vinny, along with Marisa Tomei as his fiancÃ© Mona to save the day. From there the movie jumps into the trial proceedings rather quickly, where in Movie and TV Land murder trials are scheduled just a week after arraignments! The movie proceeds to discuss the lack of trial experience Vinny has, especially with murder cases. There is a side plot involving the judge (played by Fred Gwynne) begrudgingly approving Vinny to practice law outside of New York and Vinny using aliases to distract and stall him while he proceeds with the defense. Lane Smith does an underrated job as the D.A., playing his character sly but fair. Pesci and Tomei get the majority of the laughs throughout the film as they navigate the terrain of Southern Living and their domestic issues. There's a neat scene early on if you pay attention where they are arguing about something trivial with both of them so wanting to win and you realize that's why this May December romance works. Pesci earns his chuckles from playing the fish out of water New Yorker. Tomei charms her way into an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress and somehow comes up with a new outfit for every day of the trial even if they don't live there. Macchio and Whitfield don't really have much to do here except have a front row seat watching the pros run with it, which is easy for all us to do at home as well. Enjoy.",0.0
2302,"Underrated.; Underrated. I won't belabor relating and describing the plot, because that's been recited nicely by numerous others. I'll simply return to my one word point. Underrated. Even though Marisa Tomei broke through and won Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards for her performance, an award she earned and much deserved, I still say underrated. This film really never got on the public's radar the way it should have, probably because there are no big-name actors featured as box office draw. Joe Pesci was as good as it gets that way. In 1991 he was the hottest name in the cast. But has Joes Pesci ever established himself as a leading man who could carry a movie by himself? I ask that in open-ended wonderment, and certainly not disparagingly. Just asking, is it fair, has it ever been fair, to expect Joe Pesci to carry a film? Regardless of Joe Pesci's latent starpower, this cast of players as assembled possessed remarkable chemistry in the performances they gave, not only in their interactions with one another, but also in the creation of a final product that excels way beyond the sum of its parts, beyond any of their individual levels of genius, certainly beyond anything that could ever have been reasonably expected of them. Competent though they may have been, these were not thespian heavyweights or comedic savants. You ever wonder why this singular performance 15+ years ago and counting remains Marisa Tomei's magnum opus? That might be one big reason why. The Germans have a word for this. It's called gestalt. My inclination is to give most of the credit for this winning final product to director Jonathan Lynn. It seems obviously to be his creation. Who else singularly deserves it? Along the way it would have been such a cheap trick and easy thing to surrender to the obvious, but Lynn didn't do it. This is a story built around stereotypes. New Yorkers. Ethnic Italian New Yorkers. Southerners. Small town southerners. Southern justice. Southern small town justice with New York Italians in the dock. It would have been so easy to traffic in those stereotypes, to over-the-top cash in on them, to submerge the movie in them and to exploit them for all they were worth. These people could have been made into cardboard cartoons of themselves. Surely the Englishman Lynn was thusly tempted, but it was a temptation he mainly resisted. Oh, almost obligatorily, he dances us over to that edge and gives us a big whiff of all that, but instead of jumping in and wallowing in the stereotypes, he deftly pulls it back and carries it all off and away in a new and different direction, indeed in an uplifting direction. Just as there are no cheap tricks in this movie, there are no cheap shots either. People are not ridiculed for who they are or where they are from. It rises above that. Lynn raises it above that. Yes, the regional differences that exist are juxtaposed. And yes, we get the fact that cultural differences divide these characters. But the beauty of it is that no one is treated unfairly. In fact, the viewer comes away with the feeling that these are all good people. Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei are given a broad canvas to create great humorous art, bouncing one, two, three liners or more off of each other, at the other's expense. It's the game they play with each other, the nature of their characters' relationship, and it's fun to watch. And this must be said: not only does Marisa give an exquisite performance, she is an utterly delightful feminine creature to watch here. As for the southerners, in not taking the bait to exploit the southerners as dumb hicks, Lynne actually captures part of the true but rarely portrayed essence of the south: polite gentility. Lane Smith embodies that essence. And Fred Gwynne? He practically steals the show, and would have were it not for Marisa Tomei. What has been going through Joe Pesci's and Marisa Tomei's heads for the last 15 years? What is wrong with their agents? These two needed a sequel. If not a sequel, then more film(s) together. The dynamic between them was too good to just be abandoned. We should have been treated to much more of them together. As a trial lawyer let me say that the portrayal of courtroom events, while certainly not perfect, is more than adequate and passable. One thing that is accurately captured is the fish-out-of-water experience of a city lawyer when subjected to trying a case in a far-flung rural county. This depicton conveys the essence of what that's like. This movie deserves more recognition. It is clever, funny, and fun. I recommend it. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and indulge yourself.",0.0
4326,"mediocre and predictable, but Hackman excels; I cannot comment on how closely this film tracked to the real life events that it supposedly follows. But as a movie, it falls short of it's potential by lapsing into the preachy and stereotypical Hollywood style which has become so commonplace in today's cinema. I doubt there are many souls left today who would deny that the KKK did some horrific things, or that there wasn't a pervasive racist culture in the South in the early 60's. But if there are, this movie tries to dispel all remaining skeptics with the subtlety of a lead balloon. By trying to tie up hatred and bigotry into one neat little package (by compartmentalizing and homogenizing groups of people), the movie fails in a rather big way. I mean, how many times have we been fed the message that all southerners are ignorant racists, that all blacks are innocent bystanders barely capable of controlling their own destinies, or that liberal educated whites are the saviors of the human race. Hardly original (or truthful). Beyond the problem of the ""message"", the movie has other faults. William Dafoe just isn't, in my opinion, believable at all. From his overly done ""Kennedy-esque"" appearance to his constant idealistic waning (the obvious target being the ""uneducated audience""), his authenticity never rings true. And did dozens upon dozens of FBI agents really wade into the Mississippi swamps without regard for their expensive suits? Well, if they did, perhaps it just shows that educated Northern white boys aren't that smart after all! Finally, if director Alan Parker's intent was to leave us in the lurch regarding Anderson's and Mrs. Pell's ""relationship"", he succeeded with flying colors. On a positive note, Gene Hackman's performance is excellent. He holds it all together....well, he IS the movie. His delivery, mannerisms and character make Mississippi Burning quite enjoyable to watch from a cinematic point of view. Also top notch was Brad Dourif as Deputy Pell. Their performances almost make up for a mediocre and all-too-often condescending film",0.0
4326,"Now this is how you make a movie.; Wow what a picture. This movie sets precedents for bringing to the limelight of how society was just 44 years ago (26 years ago when this movie was made). It's amazing to see how tolerant we have become in just a short period of time. This movie really speaks it's mind and holds nothing back. The acting is superb and the plot is one that can keep me interested up until the end. They don't make many movies like Mississippi Burning. Some part in this film are just so utterly powerful, it's hard to find any bad things about it. Willem Dafoe gives it his all, and he's a great actor. Of course Gene Hackman is very convincing as the tough agent whos morals outweigh his dedication to the FBI. If you are going to make some sort of statement in a movie, this is the best way I can think to do it. By simply making it a high powered, entertaining motion picture, your message can be widely accepted by its viewer and therefore making your statement known and clear. Good job guys! 8/10",0.0
71057,"What happened?; I am still scratching my head trying to figure out what the point of this movie was. Of course, I was set to see something I've seen before - like a Matrix / Maximum Overdrive kind of plot - but still expected an actual plot, even if it was an overused one.... So, the descriptions say that humanity is threatened...well - from what I saw, there were no humans. And only a handful of...what... sack people? robots? What were they?? And so they contain the soul of the scientist. So what? and so what now? There are STILL no humans.... and why is the soul of ONE person going to make any difference? Once the sack robots break down, or die off, or whatever it is they do, then what? Watching this movie just made me angry. I gave it even a 3 because the graphics are good, and I like Christopher Plummer, and because I actually did watch the whole thing, so it must have kept my mild interest enough for me to want to know if the movie ever came to any logical conclusion (yes, I have turned off movies without finishing them). But, I was not satisfied in that regard, and still am left confused and irritated by this movie.",0.0

4326,"Powerful but not as moving as it should be; Based on a true story. In 1964 Mississippi three civil right workers (2 whites, 1 black) disappear without a trace. FBI agents come to investigate--southern Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) and straight-laced by the book Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe). Anderson knows the south and the racism and believes in fighting dirty. Ward wants to go by the book and is a calm influence. They soon realize that the workers may be dead--and the town is covering it up. This received tons of negative publicity when it came out. It was based on a real life case and people said this movie distorted the facts or told outright lies. People don't seem to realize this is a FICTIONAL movie! It's not a documentary and doesn't pretend to be. It just uses the case as a starting point to show the ugly racism and hatred back then in Mississippi. It's VERY well made but somewhat disturbing to watch. There's plenty of swearing and a certain ""n"" word is used constantly. It's an important movie...but it never connected with me emotionally. I WAS horrified to see what went on then and LOVED seeing the white guys getting it at the end...but I found it simplistic. All the white guys (save FBI agents) are ignorant vicious southerners who HATE blacks. All the black people just sit back and take all the violence directed at them without even attempting to fight back. How about all those freedom marches that happened back then? The clashes between black and white? They never happened? Turning the whites into monsters and all the blacks into victims was not the way to go. It distorts what the civil rights movement was like. I was always kept at a distance. The violence was strong and horrific (as it should be) but it never moved me. Still this is worth catching. Hackman is outstanding in his role (and was nominated for an Academy Award) and Frances McDormand is great in her too few scenes. Dafoe is a disappointment. He plays his character TOO straight-laced and unemotional. I got annoyed with him rather than cheering him on. Everybody else does great. This is far from a perfect film but it shows us a somewhat accurate portrayal of 1964. I'm glad this is being shown in high schools and colleges. I give it an 8.",0.0

6101,"One of the Most Powerful and Sharp Films of the Cinema History; In September1973, in Chile, the American journalist Charles Horman (John Shea) arrives in Santiago with his friend Terry Simon (Melanie Mayron) to meet his wife Beth (Sissy Spacek) and bring her back to New York with him. However, they are surprised by the military coup d'Ã©tat sponsored by the US Government to replace President Salvador Allende and Charles is arrested by the military force. His father Ed Horman (Jack Lemmon), a conservative businessman from New York, arrives in Chile to seek out his missing son with Beth. He goes to the American Consulate to meet the Consul that promises the best efforts to find Charles while the skeptical Beth does not trust on the word of the American authorities. The nationalism and confidence of Ed in his government changes when he finds the truth about what happened with his beloved son. ""Missing"" is one of the most powerful and sharp films of the cinema history and a must-see for people of my generation, raised in military dictatorships in South America sponsored and trained by the US Government. After more than thirty years from the first time I saw it, ""Missing"" is still impressive, with top-notch performance of Jack Lemmon. The first work by Costa Gravas in the American cinema could not be better, exposing the hidden wounds about the participation of the American government in Chile bloodshed. Unfortunately and surprisingly this film has only been released on VHS many years ago in Brazil and I had to buy an imported DVD to change the media. My vote is ten.

8838,"Alice in Reality Land ...; Alice is a pearl Â… she's the kind of everyday heroine the world needs today Â… in French, they call them ""mere courage"" meaning literally ""mother bravery"" and God, I respect this woman, and I respect Martin Scorsese, the one who made the ultimate guy movies, for having dedicated such a great film for women, those misunderstood wonders of the world that we, men, use, to make ourselves feel like men Â… God bless you, Marty ! and Bravo, for Ellen Burstyn, for having portrayed such a character! Alice, what a wonderful name, she reminds me of a poor little girl plunged in a surrealistic world where everything seems against her Â… I don't know if it's an homage to Lewis Carrol's titular heroine, the fact is that this film is a psychological road movie in the soul of a fragile creature that has a bad day, a long bad day, that tunnels us in the deepest fears and sentimental problems that a woman in the middle of the 70's could encounter ... and I sincerely hoped, all through the film, that this tunnel would end in a light of hope Light is not something this movie lacked, Ellen Burstyn's smile is the sunshine that enlightened my heart, and made me wish that her dream to become a singer would finally be true Â… but this is a dream, and she's Alice. Marty, I know you're smart enough, and I didn't expect a happy ending, nor a cynical one, this is a movie about women, about mothers, and I'm glad that you handled it with the respect we all owe to our mothers, our women Â… Not that I'm surprised, but I was worried, and I'm glad that all ended that ended well for her The story of Alice started with a homage to the ""Wizard of Oz"", a nice touch to remind us that sometimes our dreams are part of a sort of surrealistic world that doesn't take today's harshness into consideration Â… not surprising though, that 27 years later, we find Alice as a devoted mother trying to balance between an annoying but harmless little brat and a dominating husband figure Â… from the beginning, we understand one thing, that dear Alice needs a break, but need in Scorsese's movies are not necessarily fulfilled, not without the touch of fate anyway, the same touch that decided to precociously make Alice, a widow ... But a widow is not the character that suits her, she basically can't live without a man, why? Because despite everything, this is not a feminist movie, it's about reality, idealization leads to disappointment while realism provides hope, the same hope that guided Alice to look for a better future for her, and her child Â… ""mere courage"" again. Crisis and opportunity are almost synonyms in the world of Alice, she's always about to breakdown BUT never does. That's the very aspect of her personality, she's so fragile that she needs a man, but not enough to become dependent. Marty, you were a precocious genius, because even though you probably didn't understand women Â… who did and who will, anyway? Â… You directed a movie with all the humility in your heart and let women guide you, to make us understand the truths that lie beneath the beauty Â… they can be singers, wives, widows, or waitresses, these poor little souls are the greatest thing God ever created. And WE, we, men, don't deserve them. Indeed, what I learned from Alice, Bea, or Flo is that there's a whole universe inhabiting these hearts, and we try to gain self-respect, we try to affirm our masculinity in the most cowardly way, by reducing to dominated objects those creatures who just want to be protected, understood, loved, and we're too weak to admit how needy we are Â… We all need women Â… and I'm glad, you Marty, didn't caricature the purpose of the film, by making all the men equal to Donald, a decent but rude guy, or Ben, Harvey Keitel, a brief but powerful performance. We have something in common with them, but there's an inner David in us, Kris Kristofferson as the man who redeemed us all. David is the good guy, with a living and a need of love, no surprise he immediately felt for Alice Â… but there was the boy, the product of a spoiled education worsened by the absence of a fatherly figure, this could have lead to the worst clashes, but Marty's film is more lighthearted than what I'd thought, and it's better this way. It's not a female version of Taxi Driver, despite the presence of a superb Jodie Foster, in a promising performance. It's an inspiring film where Alice will finally have the break she always dreamed of. Alice, after facing so much brutality, and others expressions of masculine weakness, will finally find the strength in its most honest and even clumsy way, but clumsy for a man almost means sincere Â… and I was glad that despite everything, she ended up, with David Â… will she become a singer? Will she fulfill her dreams ? At least she's with a man ... but this is not a male victory, the real winner is Alice and no one else. This is a movie about women, but made by a man and it couldn't have been more honest and sincere about the way we treat our wives and mothers Â… we're bad, we're flawed, but God knows we need them Â… the movie is like a humble cinematic apology, from one of the greatest directors of his generation, and allow me to be among those who say : ""Sorry for the way we treat you"". I love your films, Marty, I loved Alice and God knows how I love women Â… and Mom, especially",0.0

He soon learns that the bat isn't his motives for being there, but he is actually there for something else completely at which time his true detective skills surface so he can get to the bottom of this. This movie made me laugh a few times, which the first didn't. I still think it is a horrible movie with a lot of over the top acting and so stupid that only a 5 year old should watch it. It had a couple laughs though so I can't completely hate it. Steve did such a better job directing than the guy from the first one. This movie actually had a better story, better settings, the antics were less and it was more serious, It had much more to offer. The movie was bad but several things made me like it enough to give it a higher rating than part 1, which I gave 1 out of 10 stars. I liked the parody of Cliffhanger, I loved the joke made referencing the Twilight Zone episode with William Shatner, I loved the part where he wears the little man around his neck to mock the woman with the fur and I laughed at him squeezing out of a tiny hole in the butt of a rubber Rhino. The acting was better, Carrey went from 350 grand on the first film to 5 million on this one. Adawale had a small role and I think he is a great actor and Tommy Davidson who had worked many times with Carrey on IN LIVING COLOR did a great job as the tiny warrior. These two movies were big, and spawned so many catch phrases but it just isn't my thing - my true vote is 1.5 out of 10 stars but I went ahead and gave it 2 here on IMDb to let myself know in the future that I liked it better than the first.",0.0

""Curse of the Golden Flower"" is another beautiful visual film from Zhang. The storyline is about a Royal family in turmoil. Gong Li and Chow Yun-Fat are good as usual, and the acting on the whole is strong. So what's wrong with this movie. I think it's quite simple. The movie is basically set-up for failure. The whole time it seemed as if Zhang might have been trying to out-do himself - spending so much time on set pieces that he kind of left the cinematography in the drawer. The other problem is the storyline. There's no payoff for the viewer, and we don't get any likable qualities from any of the characters. There's no one to root for! It was a hard watch - hard enough that the visuals couldn't save the day. The visuals ARE spectacular, but this movie was a labor of LOST love for both the director and the audience.

This movie has nice visuals, but seriously lacks depth. Characters are extremely weak and some of them have no personality. Their acting is full of clichÃ©s (multiple gasps at certain moments, ""don't go there"", ""we must help"", etc), there is no character development. At many times I had a feeling that characters act illogically/unrealistically. Movie tries to be dramatic, but fails. The ending doesn't feel right (although it can be called a happy ending), and could be different, possibly better, more fantastic. I can think about at least one way it could be more entertaining. Overall, when characters don't talk to each other, the movie is good. When they start talking it is really bad, and hard to watch without cringe, because dialogs are mediocre, and acting (both voice and non-voice) could use improvement. I must admit, that despite what one of other posters said, movie does explain what happened. The details are just scattered a bit across the movie. Anyway, if you want only good visuals, this is a movie for you, and kids might enjoy it (not sure if it is fully suitable for small kids). If you want solid work with good script and acting, then ""Corpse Bride"", ""The Incredibles"", ""Ratatoille"", ""Toy Story"", ""Resident Evil: Degeneration"" (even though it is not a kids' movie), ""Wall-E"", ""Coralaine"" or Pixar's animated short called ""Presto"" will be much better choice - they are all superior to this movie in terms of acting and story quality.

Personally I'm not the most presumptuous person on the planet but I recall meeting with a condominium board submitting my application for approval on a duplex. This dwelling consisted of three upstairs bedrooms, two baths, washer/dryer with backyard and front porch. I was self employed with no debts and as far as I knew the board would whisk my application through toot sweet. Three middle aged persons sat across from me. The assessors went over my application with a look of disdain. I wondered what the looks of concerns were as they gazed upon those printed sheets. After a while I said ""WELL""? They pulled out my credit report and found an item from 1982 where I was late on an equipment payment that amounted to $3000.00. To my knowledge the payment was made but the bad mark stood on my record. They told me to leave the room for a decision. A few minute passed, the condo board called me in and rejected my condominium application. I was shocked , I was livid, I was beside myself. I told them there all full of S--t!

The two New Yorker's step out of there car totally out of place looking for Chinese food in rural Alabama. Attorney Gambini goes to the local prison to meet his defendants. Stan never met Vinny and thought he was another inmate wanting to have relations with him until cousin Billy wakes up and explains that this is our attorney. Stanley questions his credentials which are paltry and non applicable to this case . Vincent goes on about passing the Bar exam in 6 tries with zero courtroom experience. On to the hearing where Vinny Gambini meets the prosecutor Jim Trotter (Lane Smith) and the Judge The honorable Chamberlain Haller (Fred Gwynne). Vinny seems very confident and comfortable sitting on the defendant's desk. The writer of this movie was very stringent in courtroom procedure which was very necessary in the making of the film. Vinny Gambini's abrasive behavior clashed with the Yale grad southern Judge as Vinny found himself time after time in contempt and off to prison for a good nights sleep with his defendants. Fred Gwynne plays the skeptical Judge as he constantly questions Gambini's experience or lack off. Procedure is Gambini's weakness but his he makes up for it in his aggressive questioning style in grits preparation, dirty screens and failing eye glasses. Marissa Tomei expertise in auto-motives is masterful despite being a hostile witness. Austin Pendleton adds some stuttering texture to a comedy filled trial you soon wont forget. The hysterical dialogue between Gywnne and Pesce would make a sullen John Housman crack a smile. Unfortunately this was one of Fred Gwynne's final performances as he was battling cancer and passed away a year later.",0.0
4326,"A tale of the Civil Rights movement, told in a way no textbook ever could.; Populated with a cast of some of the heaviest hitters in Hollywood, this film is incredibly powerful.  It never pulls a punch from frame one...you feel every bit of fear, anger, pain, frustration and outrage that radiates from the screen.   Hackman and Dafoe are remarkable as the two FBI agents Ward and Anderson...the tension between them is completely believable. Yet the most outstanding performances are given by two of the finest chameleon actors around; Frances McDormand (who garnered an Oscar for this film) and Brad Dourif (Oscar nominee for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest), both of whom are so complete in their work that it actually takes a moment to recognize them--you forget they are actors.  This cast managed to tell a difficult story about a difficult time and never once did the characters become caricatures. Look also for a moving performance by a  young Darius McCrary who later became Eddie Winslow of Family Matters fame.",0.0
50005,"Red Lanterns, the return; I went to see this movie with a slightly heavy heart. I have been a huge fan of Zhang Yimou since seeing Ju Dou and Raise the Red Lantern some years ago. But while i really enjoyed 'Flying Daggers' as pure entertainment, i thought 'Hero' was little more than a beautiful propaganda piece for the government of China. Based on reading some reviews of 'Curse', i was beginning to think that he was the new Leni Riefenstahl. But how wrong I was - I'm very surprised that all the critics who lined up to explain to western audiences the anti-government metaphors of his earlier movies have reviewed this as a pure soap opera, a glorified 'Dynasty'. But they seem to forget that the exact same could be said of his earlier masterpieces such as Red Lantern. Those movies too were sometimes stagy and fully of internal dramatic inconsistencies that didn't stand up to too much analysis. But this movie is every much a devastating critique of centralized power as any of his earlier movies. Anyone with even a passing acquaintance with Chinese history and politics knows that the current government of China is very much a continuum of earlier dynasties, with Party Officials performing the same roles as the old Confucian bureaucrats. This movie is a straightforward satire of such centralized power with clear modern parallels. The clearing up of the aftermath of the 'coup' and the similarities with what happened after Tiananmen Square in 1989 is all too obvious. Anyway, having gotten that off my chest, suffice to say this is a gloriously over the top epic with staggering settings and set pieces, and of course it has Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li in the same movie, which should be enough pure pleasure for anyone. I had my strong doubts up to this, but I think in years to come critics will see this as one of a series of truly masterful movies from Zhang Yimou that will collectively consist of a coherent and brilliant artistic and political statement, not to mention pure kick ass cinematic pleasure.",0.0
6493,"Cute but too much yada yada yada; In ""Alex & Emma"" Alex, a writer, Alex (Wilson), spends most of the run dictating a romance novel to his stenographer, Emma (Hudson), in his Boston apartment. As the novel develops, Emma becomes more involved in the process and, of course, in Alex. Periodically the film cuts away to vignettes in the world of the novel with Wilson and Hudson playing the lead characters. As a result we get to watch the couple slowly gravitate toward one another with predictable results. Overall the film is watchable though not memorable, eminently predictable, and relies heavily on Wilson and Hudson. Production value is par, the chemistry is just so-so, the ending is clever and twisty, and the sum of the parts is something which will be most enjoyed by sentimental romcom junkies. (C+)",0.0

50005,"A beautifully woven tale; Wow... I watched the movie recently and was totally swept away by it. The story is well-told, events occurring in sequence and actually making sense! Unlike some movies... hehe. Each new scene reveals a bit more of the story and dark underlying secrets. There are many hidden relationships and secrets which threaten to overturn plots and lives. Each new scene changes the circumstances for each character. This film is very colourful, literally. The palace and all the main royals are decorated in golden clothes and jewels. So it is quite stunning to the eye. This movie is quite sad and depressing throughout the movie but the mood interests the viewer more, rather than making them wanting to just leave and try to get rid of the unhappy mood. It finishes with a dramatic ending. A downside of this movie was the editing was poor in a few places, such as music would suddenly cut off when scenes changed. I thought the actors did a wonderful job of portraying their role. The way they spoke, facial expressions, stance, etc. all were suitable for their character's position and made the movie feel more real. Overall, a riveting if not depressing movie. Worth a viewing!",0.0
5214,"A little TOO mild but has its moments; Mild mannered grocery store assistant manager Jerry Landers (John Denver) gets a visit from God (George Burns). God tells him to spread the word that He is still alive and that people have to believe in Him and take care of the world and themselves. Landers tries to convince people that he met God and pass on his message, but everybody--including his loving wife (Teri Garr)--think he's crazy. Mild comedy that became a huge hit. It looks (and plays) like a TV movie but that's probably why people liked it--it gave them something that they were used to and doesn't try to make them think or react. The wonderful casting choice of Burns as God and his impeccable comic timing and non-stop one-liners make this enjoyable. The problem is that it might make you smile or laugh a little but there are very few very funny bits--just amusing ones. There's absolutely no edge or dark side to any of this. Also the plot has holes in it (the ending is VERY abrupt) and Denver is just so-so in his role. However all the supporting roles are filled with great comedic actors (Paul Sorvino is VERY funny as a phony religious reverend) and it moves fairly quickly. When this came out there were protests (by people who hadn't even seen the film) in front of theatres saying the film made fun of God and Catholicism. After a week or two they disappeared after people actually saw the movie wasn't an insult. A little TOO mild but enjoyable. I give it a 6. Followed by the truly terrible sequel ""Oh God! Book II.""",0.0
4326,"The Movie is Awesome; This movie was spectacular since it delivered a message to everyone who watched the horrible crimes that were being committed to the people and their race. In this movie, you basically cannot stop watching after the first few minutes because it shows everyone who is watching that some civil rights workers were murdered in their own car by policemen, or sheriff. This movie is the best I have seen and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves to watch suspense movies filled with crime and drama. Just from watching this movie in school, I have realized that nowadays, the racism part in our world is not as bad as before, although we still have to stop racists. This movie delivers a message, and is definitely on the top of my list. GO Watch it!",0.0
4326,"Stereotypical portrayal of the southern whites.; I hated this movie. It is not that I don't think what some did in the South wasn't a horrible crime, but this film stereotypes the South. Senator Julian Bond, a black senator, rightly said that the 'FBI really did nothing for blacks in the South'. I can't disagree with this. I love Hackmann, but his character is an insult. He is shown as trying to be Robin Hood, but that wasn't the truth. I also am tired of movies that stereotype poor southern whites. In this movie, all white and poor southern males are portrayed as ""monsters"". That's bigotry just as bad as any bigotry. Worse than that, it is false history. Just like how Gone Like The Wind glorifies the Northerners and the wealthy plantation owners, it was the Northerners and the wealthy plantation owners who ruined the South - pitting poor whites against poor blacks. So, where is the ""evil"" rich white character in this movie? Nowhere. In other words, all poor whites are ""evil"", but you can't possibly indict rich northerners and rich southerners, who kept poor people of both races enslaved and against one another.

The story is, I believe, pretty well adapted for screen and they certainly spared no expense on the cast, having huge names in it. Alas, it is a poor production. Sure, it's hard to make monsters look real, but it seems that they barely tried. I had to work hard not to laugh aloud, especially at their depiction of Medusa! I think their SFX budget was $20. Now I know that SFX weren't as advanced as they are now, but they were certainly more advanced than what they used in the film. But the STORY carries this film (barely). The acting is pretty fair across the board, but not up to the stellar cast in the film. I may watch this again, but it'll be a while.",0.0

Facing a wall of silence and unwittingly sparking off a chain of tragic events instigated by the Klu Klux Klan, the FBI have to bend the rulebook to get to the truth. Alan Parker's most moving and powerful film since Midnight Express, is an adrenalin emotion rush from start to finish.  Gene Hackman (easily his best performance since the French Connection) and Willem Dafoe are the perfect mismatch of partners.  Mr Ward (Dafoe)the FBI agent that plays everything by the book and Mr Anderson(Hackman),old school FBI who is the complete opposite.  The two men are an absolute joy to watch.  With Hackman you see every piece of Masterclass acting, from facial expressions, his laughing, every little detail. While Dafoe couples with Hackman to make them both light up the screen and bring their characters to life. Support from Brad Dourif (Deputy Pell) as the Sheriff's deputy and Michael Rooker as the unashamedly racist Frank, add to the masterclass and all help a fantastic script with some amazing dialogue move along at the perfect pace which if you can keep up with, the rewards from this film are of the highest and most thought provoking ever felt on celluloid.",0.0
4326,"Powerful stuff, but bring an iron stomach; I have no idea how accurate MISSISSIPPI BURNING is, and I imagine a lot was changed for the purposes of making a movie. But geez, what a story. And make no mistake; it is rough going. There's all sorts of backwards sentiment to make you sick. The movie's got hate oozing through the seams. Most of it's revolting, sometimes horrifying. But as a gripping thriller, it is top-notch. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are the shining stars of this whole thing as two cops clashing over different styles of handling the same case. Two amazing performances, and these guys work well off of each other. But there's great work from Frances McDormand, Brad Dourif, Michael Rooker and R. Lee Ermey (Dourif and Rooker, especially, who embody such hateful scum beyond belief). It's a great piece of drama, but also one that bluntly shows a different world in the south. And that world's not easy to stick around in. There is justice in the end, but just knowing that the good guys had to get their hands dirty to effect it leaves you all the more conflicted, just as it does our hero FBI agents. But when all is said and done, even if the movie's subject matter is hard to swallow, MISSISSIPI BURNING is wholeheartedly, without a shadow of a doubt worth watching for Gene Hackman. The man is at his peak in this movie, and his fluid transition from charming to outright menacing can be witnessed in the bar scene. Mesmerizing stuff. Hackman's abilities are beyond question. 8/10",0.0
6101,"The Good and The Bad . . . .; The photography is striking and the performances uniformly okay. There is a stunning shot in which a search is being made of a vast morgue and the camera tilts upward to show us the shadows of dozens of dead bodies sprawled on the glass skylight. Jack Lemon does ""anxiety"" pretty well and Sissy Spacek is a competent actress. It's the story of Lemon as an American businessman whose son goes missing during a coup in Chile. So, unable to get any information or cooperation over the phone, he flies to Chile and questions Charlie's wife, Spacek, the Americans at the embassy, and anyone else who will talk to him. Lemon is at first irritated and treats Spacek as an irresponsible adolescent because she and Charlie were mixed up with some political group in a foreign country instead of building a business and living a bourgeois life back home. Oh, maybe ""well meaning,"" sure, but not very realistic and it was none of their business. Gradually he learns that the group of young American idealists were considered dangerous by the military junta that assassinated the constitutionally elected head of government. The military were backed by the CIA, it is broadly hinted. I didn't like the movie. It could only reach three types of people. (1) Those who never heard of a CIA-backed coup in Chile. (2) Those who know all about it and will applaud the condemnation of most of the American values on display. And (3) those who, like me, have a general understanding of what happened, who find the actions of the CIA despicable, and who resent being talked down to as if we were a gaggle of chimpanzees. Really. Costa-Gavras is going to enlighten me about an American coup of a South American democracy for the advantage of American business interests? Hell, I owned a few shares of Anaconda Copper at the time, whose mines the constitutionally elected government of Chile had just nationalized -- and I wasn't particularly devastated by the loss of a few dollars in order to see democracy at work in one of the most civilized nations of the continent. The tragedy was seeing it turned into just another routine military dictatorship, making sure that pro-American business was carried on as usual. Jack Lemon is the proxy for the audience. He represents us. The perfervid but innocent kids that Charlie worked with were putting out a raggedy paper. Lemon is surprised to find that they were spending eighteen hours a day working on it. He thought they were sitting around smoking ""pot"" or lazing around on the beach, balling each other's girls. And the kids uncover dangerous information, like the US is sending a NAVAL ENGINEER to Bolivia, ""a landlocked country."" It's presented to us as shocking, but any of us can think of a dozen reasons why an engineer of any sort might be valuable in Bolivia or anyplace else. If Lemon represents us, the director (and writer) must believe our veins run with the blood of Neanderthals. This is Costa-Gavras' least anti-American film but I don't like it. The script considers us all idiots and materialists. But mainly I dislike it because I don't like being preached to. Costa-Gavras can still reach me, but he's got to do better than dividing the world into simple good (them) and simple evil (us) before it happens. If he's going to propagandize us, let him do a better job.",0.0
6493,"Eh, Mush!!; I'm no big fan of the romantic comedy genre, but every now and then there are some romantic comedies that I actually liked such as Kate & Leopold and Maid in Manhattan.  Unfortunately, Alex & Emma will not be added to this exclusive and prestigious list. I don't even think many fans of the genre like this movie anyway, because it's missing one of its components - comedy!  There wasn't any moment at all that I thought was even remotely funny.  There were attempts but they were all air-balls (thought I should throw in a sports metaphor to keep things balanced)!  The most painful example was when the Cuban Mafia guys made an appearance in Alex's story as some dancing loan sharks or something.  If this were performed in front of a live crowd, you'd hear crickets and see a tumbleweed blow by. And speaking of the story within the story, Alex's novel is just plain boring, uninteresting, and unfunny.  I scoffed when Rob Reiner's editor character told Alex that he thought the novel was great upon completion. Are you kidding me?!  Be truthful, Rob, say the book sucked!!!  Of course, that's not going to happen, because everything has to work out perfectly for the two lead characters. Even through the horrible story, I still somewhat cared about Kate Hudson and Luke Wilson's characters.  Maybe that's a testament to their acting skills.  Kate Hudson is just beautiful, and I can probably watch her in just about anything (so maybe this movie wasn't a total loss?!)  As for Luke Wilson, he portrays the everyman that we can identify with, such as his character in the hilarious Old School.  Although I wondered why Luke Wilson's character would want to write such a crappy romance novel. Nevertheless, the two leads are the strength of this movie, but that's about it.  The main story and the story inside the story hardly have any redeeming factors at all.  The setting and the costumes were just plain boring. Now, I'm a relatively new movie aficionado, and I've heard that Mr. Reiner is among the greatest directors out there, but this being my first real look at his work, I have to say that I'm not impressed.

2302,"Joe Pesci scores as a cunning defence lawyer in this entertaining courtroom comedy; Bill Gambini (Ralph Macchio) and Stan Rothenstein (Mitchell Whitfield) are arrested for murder while driving through Alabama. Although innocent they are put in jail and Bill's cousin New York attorney Vincent Gambini (Joe Pesci) is persuaded to defend them in court. The only problem is that Vinny has never tried a murder case before, has never actually been in a courtroom and has only been practising law for six weeks! In spite of his lack of experience Vinny accompanied by his girl friend Mona Lisa Vito (Marisa Tomei) travel from New York to Alabama to take on the case. Judge Chamberlain Haller (Fred Gwynne) is not too impressed with Vinny but reluctantly agrees to him representing the two boys. The friction between Judge Haller and Vinny is one of the highlights of the film and the banter between them is hilarious. A running gag through the film is that Vinny and his girl friend keep changing hotels as they are unable to get a good night's sleep due to noises outside. In spite of his lack of experience Vinny puts on a good show but there are many ups and downs before the final verdict. Some favourite lines from the film: Ralph Macchio (to Mitchell Whitfield): ""There's nothing to worry about until there's something to worry about. Just relax, please"". Mitchell Whitfield (to Ralph Macchio): ""Ridiculous, all this over a can of tuna!"". Fred Gwynne (to Joe Pesci): ""What are you wearing?"". Pesci: ""I'm wearing - er - clothes. I don't get the question"". Gwynne (to Pesci): ""Once again the communication process is broken down!"". Pesci (to Marisa Tomei): ""Thank you Miss Vito. No more questions. Thank you very, very much. You've been a lovely, lovely witness"". Not a well known film but very funny with an excellent Academy Award winning performance from Marisa Tomei. Also a welcome change of pace for Joe Pesci after his psychopathic roles in films such as ""Good Fellas"" and ""Casino"". Austin Pendleton as the public defender has some good scenes and creates a comic character in a small but effective role. Ralph Macchio and Mitchell Whitfield give excellent performances as the two wrongly accused boys and their bewilderment at the way Vinny is conducting their defence is a joy to behold.  10/10.

5214,"Good writing and a great cast; I saw this during it's initial theatrical release but I don't what would have caused me to go to see it. I guess I always liked those fantasy films that were popular from the 1940's and this seemed to fall in that genre. I did enjoy it and I've seen it a couple times on television since. This is probably the best of the Carl Reiner directed films of his that I've seen. I never saw The comic or Where's Poppa but his four comedies that stared Steve Martin were forgettable. Martin alone saved them from being total loses. I've seen glimpses of Reiner's other films on television before I switched channels but Oh God has a great cast and some great writing from Larry Gelbart. Gelbart of course is legendary as a writer and developer coming from Sid Ceasars Show of Shows in the 50's, writing A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum and Tootsie and the television series M*A*S*H. This screenplay is adapted from the novel by Avery Corman who also wrote Kramer vs. Kramer, earned Gelbart an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Comedy Adaptation. John Denver stars as a supermarket manager who is visited by God to spread the word that things can work for mankind on earth. God is played by George Burns who appears to Denver in the form of a casually dressed old man, kind of like George Burns on vacation. Burns while not being quite old enough to actually be God comes close enough. In the large supporting cast are a great ensemble of actors in Teri Garr, Ralph Bellamy, Paul Sorvino, Barnard Hughes, Barry Sullivan, Donald Pleasence, Dinah Shore, David Ogden Stiers and William Daniels. An interesting group of actors where the careers of some were on their way up while others were on their way down. Denver himself, though remaining a recording artist never had another role this big on film and would in fact over the next 20 years only make two more theatrical films and four made-for-TV movies. Victor J. Kemper is the film's cinematographer. He was hot property in the 70's with his work on the film's The Hospital, They Might Be Giants, The Candidate, The Eyes of Laura Mars, Magic, Dog Day Afternoon and Oh God. He would never again match on film the success he enjoyed in that decade. This is a good movie and worth a look and I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.",0.0
5540,"Fun movie for the whole family; I remember seeing this film when it came out in the theaters in 1981.  This kind of movie just does not get made anymore.  Come to think of it they did not get made back in 1981 either.  This film has the feel of Hollywood's golden age when epics were getting made about the past instead of the present or future.  You kept expecting Elizabeth Taylor or Kirk Douglas to walk on screen. The film is about Perseus and his attempt to save Andromada from condemnation by the gods.  To do this he must get the head of Medusa.  Only the three blind witches know where she is though, and he must cross the river Styx to get to Medusa's lair.  Needless to say the film is very story heavy as it follows our hero on his quest.  But remember back in Hollywood's Golden Age, action depended on story line, not vice versa like today.  That's why this plot heavy movie is a timeless epic. The film has very good special effects and set designs, even by today's standards.  There is something about effects when they are not generated by a computer.  They have a more 3-D look and seem to come to life.  When you watch The Matrix you feel like you are watching a cartoon.  When you see the execution procession at the end of Clash of the Titans, you feel like it is real.  After all it is, isn't it?",0.0
5540,"Pompous and humorless; There's nothing worse than a fundamentally terrible film executed with such a deplorable lack of humour and such a towering level of self-importance that it winds up as dreary and as stultifying as a double history lesson on a slow Thursday afternoon. CLASH OF THE TITANS falls into this category with ease, presenting the viewer with the curious sight of a would-be blockbuster crammed with the kind of special effects you'd expect from The Goodies or Monty Python rather than a mainstream Hollywood production, respected actors going through the motions on the promise of a healthy bank balance, and a screenplay that's both portentous and crashingly tiresome. The few attempts at humour don't work - in particular, the tin owl must be the most annoying 'comedy relief' character since the meerkat in THE LION KING, and even the sound design is dubious - when Perseus finds himself in the middle of a vast empathetic, his words don't so much echo and bounce around the huge arena as sound remarkably like they were recorded inside a biscuit tin. Neil McCarthy has a thankless role as the malformed villain of the piece - when he's not sporting a make-up job on a par with Eric Stoltz in MASK, he's transformed into a laughable claymation beastie! Didn't they have realistic animatronic tails in 1981 or what? Couldn't Rick Baker, or even Jim Henson have been called in to supervise the costume design? In short, this is a laughable, windy 'epic' that was dated when it came out, and it's doubtful that even undiscriminating youngsters would find much to occupy them now.",0.0

Joe Pesci plays Vincent LaGuardia Gambini, a Brooklyn lawyer who is asked to defend his cousin and friend from a murder charge in Alabama. Marisa Tomei as Mona Lisa Vito, Vinny's girlfriend, deserved the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, rare for a comedy to even be nominated for anything by AMPAS.

50005,"An intense drama with superb production design.; An intense drama with superb production design. It's the kind of drama that we used to see in our childhood with family politics involved and the fight is for the throne. Who is going to be the heir? How to take the throne from a king who is good at fighting but not so kind at heart? This forms the whole story and indeed that is what is the whole movie. Characters are shown as they are, and slowly as the film progresses, their real motives are revealed. From crown prince to the empress to a doctor, everyone is doing something for themselves and its their selfishness that has drowned them. At the beginning, I thought it would be hard to understand story, but as things got simpler, I started actually disliking it. It's a complex story with every character being pivotal to the culmination of the story, yet with each detail revealed I was getting to know more of the story and as knowledge grew, interest reduced and that's what happened. Yet, this is a very hardcore drama and a great drama too. We don't see so much of politics involved and each character plotting against the other in many films. Now, before I go ahead reviewing anything, costume design and set design which combine into production design are aspects I loved this movie for. The climax fight that is choreographed superbly shows a glimpse of how authentic the whole film is. From beginning to the end, the palace, the kings costume, the queen's embroidery each has it's own distinct artistry and all are beautiful. Gong Li as the empress has showed great variation in emotion and so did Chow Yun Fat as the emperor. All others showed emotion well.

1175,"Love wins over black-marketing!; Well, that's how I saw it. Obviously, such movies are open to interpretations and I will be thankful to anyone who deciphers a few events for me - for instance, what was the interligator's lover exactly trying to do whispering through pipes? He went out to save her from the butcher, so he definitely didn't want her killed! Anyway, the comedy itself was not black. It was tasteful comedy in a black setting. Aside from the ingenious ways that Aurore tried to commit suicide in (and the ingenious ways those failed), there was the little incident of the butcher trying to scare grandma Tapioca, who didn't budge but eventually saw a spider and died a 'natural death' from fear. The allegory of a whole gang, the troglos, literally 'underground'. I notice that most people here have mentioned that food became currency in the movie setting. This may not be correct as you cannot really deal in something you have fallen short of. Also, there were no instances of food being used as currency. Instead, humans did 'end up' being currency for food. Basically, the butcher had become a black-marketeer and he used the grain reserves as an exchange to deal in meat - any meat. Shortage of food also meant that children were trying to hunt frogs from a resident who ate snails and frogs - 'each to his own', as the man explains. Artistically, the duet between Julie and Louison and his play with the bubbles were delights to watch. There was also this comic-artistic scene where all residents 'matched the beat of lovemaking' in whatever they were doing - a treat of a scene just the visualisation of which deserves stars. Overall, a weird-great movie that I enjoyed being a part of (as a viewer). There may be several messages, one being - Clapet says the world is a bad place but he did not make it that way - the lesson being that if we continue to shed responsibility simply because we didn't make the world, the world would surely deteriorate into a delicatessen like this.",0.0
71057,"Visually Stunning!; I thought that this movie was a good movie. Even though this is an animated movie, it's designed for adults more than kids. In fact, I read that this is the fourth computer animated movie to receive a PG-13 rating. But let me tell you something, the visuals are absolutely amazing. I liked the way how the movie portrayed the post apocalyptic world. The story is about a group of ragtag dolls who must work together to save their comrades from machines that destroyed the humans. This is a great story, but it needs some work. That's the weak point of the movie. I am actually happy that Focus Features made a film like this because I liked the eleven minute short that was nominated for an Academy Award. Overall, this is a visually-stunning film that needs some script work. I rate this film 8/10.",0.0
1175,"Dark humorous comedy with dashes of romance and the macabre thrown in...; Never been a fan of foreign humour as it is generally very specific to each culture I find, but this film works well.. Revolves around a time possibly just after WW1 or WW2 in a block of apartments where the butcher is the landlord who in collaboration with the other tenants hires a hand who ultimately is to be food for the hungry tenants. This being a time of rationing, the tenants are hungry and the surroundings are grim. The hired hand though is more than at first seems, being an ex-circus performer and strikes up a strong friendship with the Butchers's daughter. The other tenants are a motley crew of folk, and the end result if simply fireworks. This is a very terry Gilliam-esquire type of movie, but don't let that put you off if you never liked his type of movie. This is actually a very funny film, and does not side too far with the gruesome nature that the title seems to make it out to be.... If you can take a step on the dark side of the world of cinema and be able to honestly laugh at it all, then this is for you.... Very enjoyable....",0.0
50005,"Epic, haunting, following the footsteps of Cao Yu; This movie's rough storyline was based on Cao Yu's Thunderstorm. Cao Yu (1910-1996) is a renowned modern Chinese dramatist who is regarded as ""the Shakespeare of China"". If modern Chinese drama has come of age in the 1930s, then Cao Yu and his dramatic trilogy of Thunderstorm, Sunrise and The Wilderness are a hallmark of this maturity. Rich in implications and excellent in techniques, these dramatic works are regarded as the classics of modern Chinese drama. Just before graduation in 1933 when Cao Yu was only 23 years old, he finished his virgin play Thunderstorm, to be followed up by Sunrise (1936) and The Wilderness (1937). Although the original Thunderstorm was set in a declining feudal-capitalistic family in the 30's of Chinese high society, the adaptation of the original storyline to the decadent Late Tang Dynasty setting is a job well-done. Indeed, moving the setting to the Forbidden Palace raises the intensity of tragedy and struggle exponetially, while naturally blending in stunning visuals and painstaking detailing of the historically accurate scenes of royal life. After impacting audiences world wide with heart-breaking love stories (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and impeccable martial arts and grand courage of historical Heros, Director Zhang Yimou turned dark in Curse of the Golden Flower. The characters are more 3D and complicated, the desire runs deep--no love but lust; no vision for the common good but personal goals; no promise and no hope. The decadent palace, luscious flesh and gorgeous pure gold jewelry contrast the darkness of human reality--everyone is for their desire and the result is a monstrous machine called ""the Empire"". Every frame is a master piece oil painting. A haunting, heart-twisting master piece.",0.0
5540,"Not quite that faithful to the myth; This movie was released a lot later than I had originally thought. For some reason I believed that it was made in the 60s, however as you watch the movie, noting that the special effects aren't as wonderful as, say, movies made these days, you still get the feel that the effects are somewhat more sophisticated than the average movies one would encounter in the 60s. However, we must remember that making this movie would have been a difficult endeavour in any case because, as mentioned, computer enhanced special effects did not exist back then, but rather clever manipulation with film and models. This movie is based loosely on the Ancient Greek myth of the hero Perseus and alternates between the events on Earth, and the political maneuverings in Olympus. Unfortunately, though, I would hardly call this movie one full of political intrigue. While the idea is ripe for a story of political intrigue in the halls of Olympus, it simply turns out to be a minor tussle between Thetis, Goddess of the Sea, and Zeus. Zeus is portrayed as an autocrat, who is also quite a sleaze (which is what he was in Mythology) and when the lesser gods disagree with him, they tend to mutter in secret. However, I note that a lot of Christian rhetoric about justice and mercy is spurted from the mouth of Zeus, which in the ancient world, simply was not the way of the Gods. As for the story itself, I could pick a number of holes in it, but I will chose not to. In many ways it is similar to the later movie (which was based on this film). However, it is noteworthy that Perseus was not sent on his quest from the city of Joppa (and I do not believe he ever actually went to Joppa in the legend) but rather was sent on his quest from Argos, at the machinations of the reigning king (who had a prophecy saying that Perseus would slay him). He meets Andromeda on his journey, but she was chained to a rock in Ethiopia. She was somebody whom he picked up on his return journey, rather than the center of his quest. This was an okay film, but it had enough that my year 11 history teacher decided to show it in history class once. However, while it is based on the myth, it does not follow it closely. Perseus did not travel with an entourage to find the gorgons, rather he had been given a gift of flying shoes. After he had slain Medusa, the Pegasus appeared, and he then flew back home on it. However, despite the flaws, it is still an entertaining film.",0.0
1175,"Ham On Wry; This is another for the hybridologists, you can just hear them winging possibilities like 'a cross between 'Freaks' and 'Grand Hotel', which is a way it is except that 'The Lower Depths' might be closer than the Grand Hotel. This is black comedy in spades. By distorting everything from the buildings to the faces Jeunet has imbued the whole schmeer with a Cabinet of Dr Caligari feel, a not unapposite simile given that the apartment building does verge on the asile. If you don't go along with it from image one then you'll wind up resisting it and walk out, if you do go along with it you'll have a few laffs. The actual building bears more than a passing resemblance to the apartment building in which Gabin holed up in 'Le Jour se leve', albeit a distorted version as noted earlier. Is it deliberately referential? You tell me. Certainly Prevert and Carne did not spend too much time on the other tenants whilst Jeunet explores them in depth (both higher and lower). Would a suicide maven sit in a bath of water fully clothed in the hope that an elaborate ropes-and-pulleys arrangement will result in electrocution? Does it matter. Not really. Is it fun to exploit serious myopia to the extent that someone could get badly scalded? It's fun HERE, morally is another question. Billy Wilder might have written something like this on LSD but when he came down he would have pruned it and still come up with a black comedy. 8/10",0.0
6101,"Tremendous, Lemmon's best; Ed Horman (Jack Lemmon) represents the good side of America--American life, American values, and loyalty to his country.  Unfortunately, democratically elected leftist Allende has been assassinated in Chile by Pinochet, in a right wing coup in which the U.S. was involved, and Horman's leftist son, along with his daughter-in-law, is missing.  Horman travels to South America to look for him.  Based on a true story, this is Lemmon's finest hour, showing that he can indeed excel by playing just an ordinary, good, educated person, the neighborly guy next door.  As the pieces of what happened unravel, the viewer continues to be peppered with an aura of smugness--in the face of bad things, we are told, so what?  Ultimately, family values prove supreme.

71057,"This film is one of few gems that explore the aspects of humanity; This film at it's core explores the idea of humanity and what it means to be human. It does this by exploring themes such as friendship, curiosity and discovery, family and the fundamental question we all ask ""why am I here and what is my purpose?"" What makes the film so unique is that it projects these onto the main characters which are small ragdoll like automatons who have been set with the task of undoing the wrongdoings of their creator. This film has heart and on a first viewing the core themes and story may be lost by the stunning visuals of the characters and the environment they interact within. So I recommend at least watching this film twice to really appreciate all it has to offer. This film is set In a post apocalyptic setting yet it still manages to feel so unique. The closest I can think as far as cinematography is The Book of Eli, yet this is much more menacing and darker. Although wrapped up like a children's film with the animation, it definitely is for a more mature audience.",0.0
6101,"Gavras goes Hollywood; ""The true American goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy."" - John Adams Set in Santiago, Chile, Costa-Gavras's ""Missing"" offers a slightly fictionalised account of the disappearance of American expatriate writer Charles Horman in the aftermath of a military coup. After Charles' disappearance, his wife Beth (Sissy Spacek) and his father Ed (Jack Lemmon) travel to Chile from the US. They attempt to mount a search for Charles, but promptly get caught in a Kafkaesque nightmare, thwarted by bureaucracy, blatant lies and always running into the official stonewalling of both the American embassy and Chilean authorities, both of whom insist that there are no traces of Charles. But Beth and Ed won't give up, and as they search for Charles, they begin to uncover the role of the United States in the 1973 Chilean coup. Ed, a businessman, model citizen, taxpayer and conservative member of the Silent Majority, then slowly goes through a little ""coming of age"" subplot, the elderly man forced to confront truths that his son, a freelance journalist, devoted his life to uncovering. The film effortlessly merges the personal and the political, and Spacek turns in a fine performance, but it's Lemmon who shines as a man who is forced to confront issues he spent a lifetime ignoring. In terms of flaws, the film clearly has a political axe to grind, is slightly overlong and despite a narrative that slowly builds in tension and moves toward a strong resolution, possesses many repetitive scenes. When it was first released, ""Missing"" was deemed so provocative that the then-Secretary of State, Alexander Haig, issued a categorical denial of the film's allegations, and went on to shamelessly lie about the United States' involvements in the Chile Coup. Today, cynicism is so rife, all passively accepting coups and subterfuge as a part of the political game, that the film has lost much of its edge. Still, the film has real world relevance, its events echoing even recent world history. Everyone is familiar with the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon, but Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon's plot to overthrow the Chilean government climaxed on September the 11th as well. Launching strikes on the presidential palace, the Chilean armed forces, aided by the US, kick-started a coup which led to thousands of Chileans undergoing torture and violence whilst the country's democratic institutions were swiftly and systematically dismantled. Elected president Dr Salvador Allende was then kicked out (and was soon found dead), and military puppet leader Augusto Pinochet put in place. ""The terrorists hate our freedoms,"" George Bush said post 9/11, in an effort to simplify the attacks on his country. His words echo the cries of the Chilean masses, who viewed Nixon's covert war as a specific attempt to curtail the freedoms of Chileans, who watched as their democracy (free trade unions, independent judiciary and the local media were all also dismantled) went up in flames. But US policy makers have consistently plotted to overthrow foreign governments and regimes. US forces illegally occupied Nicaragua, Cuba and Hati, sent US troops into Colombia, Honduras, the Domincan Republic, China, Syria, Korea, Morocco and Panama and between 1910 and 20, made numerous incursions into Mexico, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Turkey. From the 1950's onwards, things got worse. ""The UN and NATO be damned,"" President Eisenhower said, as he kick-started the overthrowing of the democratically elected government of Iran. Guatemala, Brazil, Ecuador, Uruguay and Mexico followed, illegal political destabilization, coups and government overthrowings now a CIA speciality. How dare foreign countries continually vote ""the wrong man"" in as president? Don't they care about US interests? In Chile's case, after the voting in of Allende, the Cia spent 3 years masterminding violence, high profile murders, economic sabotage and psychological warfare against his government, simply because Allende didn't fall in line behind Washington's dictates and refused to follow ""free"" market economics. ""Chile's economy should be squeezed until it screamed,"" Nixon famously said. In an ironic twist, Henry Kissinger, one of the terrorist figureheads behind the 1973 9/11 Chile coup, was nominated to investigate the 2001 9/11 attacks. Kissinger declined. 8/10 Â– Blunt and lacking poetry, this nevertheless possess a few great scenes. This was Gavras' first Hollywood film. Worth one viewing.",0.0
2302,"Yo, cousin Vinny! Is there anything that you could do for me?; IMDb mark: 8 I like the song. And I like the movie even more. It's very interesting when you see it for the first time, and it's still lots of fun when you see it again. This is a funny, witty, oftentimes sarcastic film that makes you really like the main characters. It entices you to wait and see exactly how the movie is going to end, even though the outcome seems fairly obvious from the get-go. But in the case of this movie, it's not about the finish line, but about the path which leads there. -Humour: The dialogue in 'My Cousin Vinny' contains a lot of swearing, but the swearing is so funny and so well mixed in with the action, that the film invariably seems dull if you try to see the syndicated TV version. Some lines are so smart and full of clever irony that you will laugh even if you've seen the scene before. It's not all funny, like the Naked Gun movies, though. 20/25 -Physical Comedy: There are a few funny bits of physical comedy; most from Joe Pesci, naturally. And it is quite entertaining to see Marisa Tomei in a backless, one-piece, flower body-suit arguing with Mr. Pesci about her biological clock. 12/20 -Plot: This film has a very interesting plot, that keeps the viewer's attention until the end. A couple of innocent-looking boys from New York are being trialed for murder in a town in Alabama, and they call Vinny, one of the boys' cousin, who is a lawyer, to help them for free. 15/15 -Ending: I liked the ending very much. Of course, taste varies. 10/10 -Theme: What can happen to strangers in a small town in the countryside, and the conflict between two completely different types of people. It's very interesting to see sparks fly due to this conflict. Of course, if you want to see this theme taken to the extreme, there's always 'Nothing But Trouble' ('Valkenvania'). 8/10 -Nudity: There is no nudity in this film. 0/8 -Cast: Joe Pesci, Ralph Macchio and, of course, Marisa Tomei are not only well-known actors, but they are also awesome in this movie. Fred Gwynne, as the judge, and Bruce McGill, as the sheriff, are great, too, and practically all the actors are very believable. 7/8 -Genre: This is a comedy. 4/4 -->Overall: 76/100 To sum it up, this is a very good movie to watch whenever you can, because it's very hard to get bored of it. For some people, it might seem even better the second time. From Swordlord, 3 swords up!",0.0
4326,"Great Drama; Mississippi Burning (1988) **** (out of 4) Alan Parker's film about two FBI agents (Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe) who travel to Mississippi to try and see what happened to three missing Civil Rights workers. I'm really not sure how to rate this film because on one hand it's an incredibly entertaining police drama that gets your blood boiling at the opening shot and it just gets hotter and hotter as the film moves along. I was having a great time watching this film and then something entered my mind that made me rather nervous. Should I be enjoying a film with this subject matter? I'm really not sure if the film is proper entertainment because even though it's based on a true story the director made no secret that events were changed up for entertainment value. The images in this film are rather harrowing and at times incredibly hard to watch but the viewer, or at least I wanted to see the racist killed. In that sense this entertainment is more like a Death Wish film when I'm not sure if should be. The images of blacks being beaten, raped and hung got me angry and my blood boiling but was it because of great film-making or because seeing these images would make any human angry? I'm really not sure how great the storytelling was but again, on one hand, it kept me entertained all the way through. What does work are the performances by the rather amazing cast. Dafoe has always been an underrated actor and his calm approach in the film is perfectly done and Frances McDormand comes off very good as well. Brad Dourif, R. Lee Ermey, Gailard Sartain, Michael Rooker and Pruitt Taylor Vince play just some of the racist and all of them are bone chilling in their performances. The group of men, on an entertainment level, make for some great movie villains. The real standout here is Hackman who delivers another brilliant performance and really has the toughest job in the film. At one point of the film he's laughing about the racist subject matter and even telling joke but in a blink of an eye Hackman changes his character to show the anger than any human would. The way Hackman juggles his character through so many emotions is a real treat to watch and in my opinion this is one of the best performances from the actor. Once again, I'm torn on the entertainment value a film like this should deliver but after thinking about it for a while I guess this is a perfect film. From what I've read, a lot of controversy surrounded this film as many people felt too many facts were changed to make the FBI look good or whatever. As I write this I'm just going to say that it might be entertainment but it doesn't coward away from showing the horrors of the South at the time.",0.0

50005,"A must see film bursting with superb subtle acting.; I just got back from watching the 8.30 pm show at Vivo City Gold Class and I must say I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable the movie was. I guess it could have been the bad press with the movie but I was really very impressed with Gong Li and Chow Yun Fat. They are true virtuosos, masters of their fields. Very impressed with the both of them. Even that Jay Chou wasn't that bad although, although to be honest, he is just too green and inexperienced. He was miscast as the 2nd Prince because of his lack of good looks, but I can see that he tried his best. But Gong Li, who acted opposite Jay as his mother was superb. Her convulsions (because of a long time illness no spoilers) were realistic. Her varied range of emotions were a joy to watch. I didn't feel she was acting; you don't see the wheels moving. Chow Yun Fat's Mandarin wasn't that bad too. Not at all. He exudes the strength and power of the ruthless Emperor. The only person whom I thought over acted was the actor, Ye Liu, who played the Crown Prince. I was not used to his acting. Now with him, you could see him acting. The action scenes were not a lot since this is more of a political intrigue film BUT the two major action scenes were very impressive. One happened at a small villa amidst the mountains. The other is the one at the end which occurred at the Imperial Palace. The only gripe I have with this film is the set decoration. It is quite garish. The colors on the pillar walls were like these tie dye t-shirts which Rupert of Survivor wore. Really odd. The costumes were not too bad. Even with my Chinese background, it was all alien to me. I am not sure it's authentic but I will give the costumers the benefit of the doubt. They must have done they research to stand by the deep cleavage of the actresses. Now I know where all the money went to. Though the set decoration can be a bit rainbow-brite for me, it certainly was opulent. Go watch this film. It is a must see.",0.0

Joe Pesci (am i spelling that wrong?) is a delightful fiery munchkin and Marissa Tomei does a great job at speaking rather loudly. the plot is.. well rather simple like most comedies (comedies aren't usually my cup of tea) but it really doesn't grow stale. I had a lot of fun with Pesci's obliviousness of legal procedures. His obliviousness wasn't hyperbolized to the point where if one really thinks about it you would wonder 'what is this fellow doing as an attorney? this is complete balderdash! arg!!!!' like lesser writers would of done * see Liar Liar*. I kinda felt like I was learning alongside Pesci and trying to prove their innocence myself which was fun. I'm a sucker for any story which tugs at the heartstrings of my schoolboy crush on critical thinking and detective work. *i'm blushing just thinking about solving a case....what? ain't nothing' weird about that. There was a delightful sinister vibe concerning the case and the peeps accusing the defendants for a while which at the end turns out to be nothing more than a teaser but it added to the fun of the film. The music is cheesy, the resolution is a tad absurd (marissa tomei knowing that much about cars, tire tracks, and every car model ever? really? come on.) and ...well.. actually thats about it for the flaws.

The highlight of the movie for me was the Awesome script and the equally extraordinary performances that the cast delivered. Joe Pesci( Gambini) was adorable and hilarious, Marisa Tomei( Mona Lisa Vito) who plays Gambini's fiancÃ©e deservingly got an Oscar for making that little role so memorable.The Judge was also great. As for the script, this movie is a perfect example of situational comedy at its best.

1175,"Form trumps content in Jeunet's and Caro's uncompromising debut; ""Delicatessen"" marks Jean-Pierre Jeunet's and Marc Caro's first film and it hit like a bomb. While despised by some, it even represents the reinvention of French cinema with new means to others, is the pathfinder of a new avant-garde, which would peak with Jeunet's later ""Amelie"". Well, ""Delicatessen"" for sure is an exalting, one-of-a-kind trip into a fantastic, twisted retro-future reality, a very unique dark comedy, quirky in all places, uncompromising in every respect. Indeed, the creative duo behind the project made exactly what they wanted to do - Jeunet, the guy who started off as a director of TV commercials and Caro, the designer/artist with the eye for the extraordinary out-of-place stuff. What is central in this kind of movie is that form dominates over content - to such an extreme degree at times that the narrative might suffer, but it is all embedded in a constantly turning kaleidoscope of impressions that sweeps the viewer with it. Everything is different, mysterious, weird in this surreal setting of a post-apocalyptic apartment building where a butcher hunts for human meat, where grain replaces money, underground living troglodytes plan a revolution and a retired clown enjoys playing the saw. ""Delicatessen"", while very original, still quotes other movies in a lot of places, and is quoted regularly since its release, clearly showing its impact as a true postmodern phenomenon. Unforgettable are moments like when the whole house suddenly begins to follow a rhythm thanks to noises traveling through its pipes, or when a closer look is necessary at one of the beds to determine a problematic spring. Sounds difficult to imagine why these are classic moments? Well, one needs to see the realization to become a believer. Or learn why to reject it. Because Jeunet movies are as he describes it best himself: Fish, not meat, and you need to be a fish person. At any rate, even if you applaud to Jeunet's resourcefulness: Enjoy him in doses!",0.0
1223,"A suitable origins tale...; Although my favourite Wallace & Gromit film will always be THE WRONG TROUSERS, a 30 minute short which got absolutely everything right - I remember wearing out my old VHS tape of it - Nick Park originally made the characters back in the 1980s and their first outing was this 1989 short. It's a slightly cruder version of the characters we've come to know and love over the years, but the magic is there from the beginning and the seeds of greatness were sown here. The story is quite simplistic in this film and lacks the kind of quick-fire gags that the series became known for. The warm character humour is missing even though Peter Sallis is a delight as Wallace. The best thing about the film is Gromit, who seems to have appeared on the screen fully formed, while the doughy-headed Wallace needed a little more tinkering before achieving perfection in THE WRONG TROUSERS (the bit where he descends the cellar steps looks really, really dodgy). The trip to the moon is light and fluffy but there are some suitably bizarre elements to keep it moving. Needless to say, the Claymation effects are huge fun.",1.0
8838,"Documentary-style account of a woman trying to survive...; 1st watched 1/9/2005 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Martin Scorsese): Documentary-style account of a woman trying to survive amidst life's ups-and-downs as an abused wife, and then a widowed mother without much help from anyone. Once the heroine's(Alice played by Ellen Burstyn) husband dies in an auto accident, we think that life will get better for her because of the abusive nature of the husband, but life is still complicated and her needs for a man still become over-bearing for her to the point of picking abusive-like boyfriends and ignoring her son's needs. This movie is more of a chronicle than a movie filled with answers. I believe, Alice understands what she needs by the end of the movie, but we're still not sure whether her life decisions will follow them or instead, her patterns that she has learned. Her tendency has been to get involved with the wrong man, leave town, and try and start all over again. She gets involved with the Kris Kristofferson character in hopes that things will be different with him. They are at first, and then his anger shows in a interaction with her son. Alice's triumph is giving this another try and whether the results are good or bad, we the audience, aren't sure but we hope for the best and that's where the story ends.

4326,"Tension versus Schmaltz - what would you choose?; Mississipi Burning will always be remembered for one of the greatest injustices delivered in modern history. Whilst no one can deny that Rainman and the performances, especially from Dustin Hoffman are top draw,it is not a patch on Mississippi Burning and yet Rainman cleaned up at the Oscars against this magnificent movie's expense. A travesty of justice but not a surprise. Once again (as with Forrest Gump), schmaltz wins the day. And yet as a piece of movie making, Mississippi Burning is one of the best I've seen for many years. The shocking and brutal way the movie unravels the story of racist bigotry in the Deep South during the Sixties is at times incredibly difficult to watch. Yet watch you will, due in part to a magnificent acting performance from Gene Hackman, backed up by a career best performance from Wilem DeFoe. Hackman & Defoe basically want the same thing - justice for some activists who have gone missing and who they suspect have been murdered. The only problem being that their methods are poles apart - Defoe does everything by the book whilst Hackman does the opposite using intimidation to divide the tight lipped community. The film is both moving and educational (and brave!) It is based on a true story and I don't really care how true the film is to this story or indeed how there may be certain historical inaccuracies or flaws. As a single coherent piece of cinema the film delivers in abundance. Even the ending whilst positive, is not euphoric and again highlights the bigotry and corruption around at the time. Many of these protagonists are spared jail but you at least get the feeling that it's 'a start'. This is not a 'feel good' film and was never meant to be. But the acting and imagery of this piece lasted longer in my memory than Rainman which whilst good, is too sentimental and gushing at times. Conclusion? Gritty, tension laden films win over schmaltz every single time.",0.0
19,"oh my god, you gotta read what I found this movie to be...; I don't normally respond to these kinds of things, but after reading some of the negative responses I couldn't help myself. There is a movie out there for everyone, something everyone NEEDs to laugh at and who can relate to. This movie is the opidemy of my humor and the extreme way it portrays the upper crust world of stuffy, snobby, self absorbed unrealistic people who think the world revolves around their view and opinions is classic and makes me laugh in a way that is honest for me. I read that some people were offended by it and want to get others to share their view. All I gotta say is, ""If you didn't like the first one, why did you go to see the second one? Just to complain?"" Do all of us ""Friends"" of Jim Carey a favor, if you don't like his humor, just go find some stuffy anal retentive ""fluff"" film, and write reviews on them that we will never read since those movies are for stuck-up self absorbed types. Sorry I just didn't think it fair that these people are ""Flameing"" this as if there are no other possibilities. Thanx for reading.",0.0
1148,"Another Nostalgic Classic!; Like the previous Wallace And Gromit short film: Wallace And Gromit In A Grand Day Out and the Aardman's short film after the one I am reviewing: Wallace And Gromit In A Close Shave, this classic escapade is one of the gems of my childhood. It is Gromit's Birthday and Wallace gives him a pair of robotic trousers. However, a penguin mastermind finds out about the trousers, so he uses them to steel a diamond from The National Museum. Gromit is worried about his friendship with Wallace when the penguin makes himself comfortable living in the same house as him. The film has a solid plot and has its own wonderful music. The short ends with Feathers McGraw (The Penguin) being locked up in the zoo and the trousers (with a dustbin over it!) walk out over the horizon where the sun goes down ending this hilarious film. A must see for anyone who likes animation. Overall Rating: 10/10!",1.0
745,"Warning, shameless laughing out loud will happen.; This short film is a classic example of fun for all the family.  I have not found anyone who dislikes any of the series which just proves the talent of Nick Park and his team at Aardman.    I didn't know which of the 3 Wallace & Gromit films to comment on but I chose this one for one piece of it that I don't think I will ever forget.  You have the rocket building scene in ""A Grand Day Out"" and the train chase scene in ""The Wrong Trousers"" and these are both excellent but not my most memorable.  The one I will remember involves the Thunderbirds scene when Wallace is transported from his breakfast table to his motor bike when he gets a window cleaning job.  It is a well thought of idea on how he is transported which is very nicely animated.  To top that though, you get Gromit coming in through a door which is only probably 5 feet away from where Wallace started with the most beautiful expression on his face.  When you next watch it, just look at the face which tells its own story, a kind of eyes raised to the heavens on the amount of time it probably took to build the contraption to get an end result of moving a few feet.  Pure class and congratulations should rightly go to all the animators involved. It is these little touches that make the series so watchable and so funny. Cracking cheese.",1.0

Sir Laurence Oliver plays Zeus, chief God of Olympus, who nonetheless finds himself challenged from within, and they use Perseus on a quest to rescue the beautiful princess Andromeda(played by Judi Bowker) who was kidnapped by former god(now a swamp monster) who plans to sacrifice her to the giant underwater Kraken.

But even if you know where the movie is going, you'll enjoy the journey. Droll Luke and vivacious Kate make great banter and ham it up with style. And you want to invite Rob Reiner over for dinner after the movie, as usual. Now, they say you should write about what you know, which is why so many movie leads are anguished writers. In this case, the way Alex writes both reveals and mocks the creative process and authors in general. For instance, the title of Alex's earlier novel makes an allusion to a much more famous romance novel (and movie) set in Cambridge, Massachusetts. So there's some wit in the screenplay that makes the movie more than just a cheap chick-flick.",0.0
5214,"God Exists.; George Burns plays God(the role of a lifetime, and how I like to think the real God is, so appealing is Burn's portrayal!)in this warm, wonderful, and very funny yet thought-provoking and moving film about Grocery store assistant manager Jerry Landers( Singer John Denver, surprisingly good and believable) who is one day contacted by God(the big G) to spread the word that he exists, and that he cares, but is not happy... Larry Gelbart's script is witty and insightful, brought to life splendidly by director Carl Reiner, who makes an amusing cameo as himself on the Dinah Shore show. Jerry also appears on her show, and once he does, his life will never be the same again...

I am amazed that the IMDb has not included Stuart Nisbet as the doorman with whom John Denver speaks. Stuart has two scenes near the elevator.

I've always had this scene stuck in my head of a road trip through the desert with the song ""Daniel"" by Elton John playing as background music and I've never actually seen it (that I remember) until last night when I watched this DVD. Talk about deja vu! My mom must have taken me to see this movie in the theater when I was 7 or 8 years old. Upon seeing it again, I also now understand why when a woman is suddenly widowed in a movie, my gut reaction is ""she's been freed."" Of course they aren't going to write a story where a woman is widowed early on and doesn't somehow prevail...but this particular story is especially poignant, mainly because she immediately gets involved with a real sh**head (played by Keitel) ...a mistake many women make in real life after suddenly finding herself alone. A pre-teen Jodie Foster turns out a great performance, and Scorcese's direction is as good as always. A great movie and a vintage womens-lib piece that is still applicable today. Girls - keep your jobs, keep your skills, get your education. Because if he drops dead or walks out (which > half of them do) guess who has to pay the bills and feed the kids? My only problem is, in the end that they had to ""sell out"" and have her stick with Kris Kristofferson after he beats on her kid. BAD Hollywood ending. BAD!",0.0
4326,"it didn't really happen like this; The recent belated conviction of Edgar Ray Killen (wouldn't you say that it's appropriate that he has ""kill"" in his last name?) brings to mind the story that inspired ""Mississippi Burning"". It's the story of how a group of Ku Klux Klan members murdered civil rights activists James Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman in Philadelphia, Mississippi, in the summer of 1964. The movie portrays the murders, but FBI agents Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) are made up. It turns out that the FBI bribed one of the murderers to rat on the other two, and all the while the FBI was tapping Schwerner's father's phone to see if he was a Communist. So, they played with the facts. Hollywood often does that. Either way, ""Mississippi Burning"" still is a good movie, reminding us of a time in our country's history when we were about to explode.",0.0

6101,"Truly Convincing; Autocracy is a government in which it disdain is shown to many individuals. The film Missing dramatically focuses on the problem of a poorly run government, in which a visiting American citizen becomesÂ… well, missing. As I watched this movie in my Modern War class, it wasn't that hard to notice that the government of Chile felt no remorse for their treatment of the residing individuals. Ed Horman's determination to find his son was, in the most part, substantial. He was a traditional minded business man who's aim was to get his son back. In addition, his repentance to be brushed off was easily noticeable. The noteworthy part is that Horman (Jack Lemmon) would not renounce his mission to locate his missing son. The shifting chemistry between Ed and Beth Horman (played by Sissy Spacek) is also a great addition to the movie. When Ed first arrived at Chile from New York, him and his daughter-in-law did not always see eye-to-eye. However, when things got more intricate and complex, they began to bond, forming a relationship. Moreover, their persistence, in my mind, was extremely significant. The deception of the American government was also a considerable issue. Being told many different stories involving the kidnapping of Charles Horman (John Shea), the protagonists of the story are not sure who to believe. This type of situation is successful in presenting an important political issue that people still deal with todayÂ… regards to the ongoing war. In conclusion, Missing does a superb job of convincing its audience.",0.0

There more adventures followed. I won't divulge more information about the storyline so one will have to watch the film to find out. In my opinion, this is the least in terms of quality and the storyline as compared to the other two shorts ('Wrong Trousers' and 'Close Shave'). The animation was a bit choppy and the storyline wasn't that good. But credit must be given to the writer for his effort in making a stop motion film.

50005,"Bloody pretty, but pretty empty; Tarantino could probably provide more contemporary celluloid examples, but the closest I can come to the plot of this elaborate epic of vicious royal conflict outside the world of Greek tragedy is the Jacobean revenge plays. And it's got the poisoning that was all the rage in those days, as well as incest. Nothing too complicated, really. An emperor (Chow Yun-fat) of the later Tang Dynasty (tenth century A.D.) is slowly killing his current consort (Gong Li), through a royal doctor whose wife Jiang Shi (Chen Jin), unbeknownst to him, is an old mistress of his and the mother of one of three possible heirs to the throne, Crown Prince Wan (Liu Ye), who is unwittingly having an affair with his step-sister, the doctor's daughter Chan (Li Man), and has knowingly been the lover of his stepmother, the empress. You could say things are rather inbred in the Forbidden City. The empress, who suspects the hourly herbal teas to treat an ""illness"" are slowly killing her (and turning her into a ""cretin""), is preparing a surprise to coincide with the oncoming Chong Yang Festival celebrating golden chrysanthemums. As the overwrought action draws to a climax one of the sons lays siege to the palace with a large army garbed in gold and embroidered chrysanthemum images, and a third son reveals another surprise: he doesn't like anybody and wants to become emperor, now. Fields of flowers are drenched in blood before it's all over, and digital armies have clashed by night, with hordes of red- or black-garbed ninjas flying down from on high to capture individual royal rebels. This grandiose affair is not without notable performances and wonderful looking people, chief among them Gong Li, whose outsize emotions are worthy of a Greek tragedy Â– except that Medea didn't have six-inch-long elaborately painted fingernails. Gong's face is mesmerizing to look at. Prince Jai (Jay Chou) looks fabulous and sexy in a war helmet. John Woo favorite gangster/cop hero of the Eighties Chow Yun-fat manages to be both appealing and scary as the emperor and Li Man as the taboo girlfriend is just the prettiest thing you've ever seen. Why doesn't it work better? I think back to the pleasure provided by House of Flying Daggers and I believe the difference lies in the claustrophobic nature of this story, most of which takes place inside a garish recreation of the palace that looks like a very, very expensive jukebox. There's just too much material here crammed into too confined a space with ornamental violence that seems too unrelated to the central core of royal machinations. I suppose these older-generation Chinese epics are the equivalent of popular folk art Â– except they don't come from the people but from an increasingly international-focused film industry whose creations are neither culturally authentic nor emotionally convincing. This is also a very nasty story. It's demoralizing to find a royal family whose members are all out to get each other. But if we got to look in on that in emotionally valid terms Â– if some time was taken to develop the feelings and conflicts instead of constantly interrupting them with kung-fu action or vast scenes of concubines all with identical cleavages, or ninjas spinning around with curved weapons in the air Â– the nastiness might develop some conviction. As it is, this is a spectacle that seems both ugly and hollow at the core. Anyone who is seriously pleased by this may not be paying much attention to what they're seeing. Sure, as a spectacle it's frequently eye-popping. But its pretense at content is superficial.",0.0

4326,"Interesting to watch; Director: Alan Parker / Starring: Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe / Release Date: 9th December 1988 The movie MISSISSIPPI BURNING is a True Story resp. is based on a True Story. It is set in the year 1964. It's about the KKK (Ku Klux Klan), black people, white people, a little town, agents and a lot of crime. There are the two FBI-agents Anderson and Ward. These two characters are played by the fabulous actors Gene Hackman (Anderson) and Willem Dafoe (Ward). They are the Hoover-Boys. Anderson is the older one and has rougher methods to solve a/this case and a long time ago he was a sheriff in Mississippi. Ward is the younger agent and he has the responsibility for this whole case, because it is his one. He only takes decisions which are in agreement with (the) law and the rules. The two have to find out who is the murderer of two whites and one black man. First they try this with Ward's methods. He demands a lot of agents. Ward looks for proof, asking questions and always obeying the law. When Ward realizes that his methods fail he needs Anderson's help. He tries to solve this case with rather unconventional methods. It works! After some time they catch the members of the Ku Klux Klan. MISSISSIPPI BURNING is a good film. Maybe not the newest one but good. It is a True Story resp. is based on a true story. Therefore it is a documentation too. It is an interesting film because after watching it you know (a bit) more about the Klu Klux Klan, differences between black and white at this time and so on.

Shaun the Sheep is so cute as himself, and Gromit proves his facial expressions are still funny. I loved Wendolene and Preston, but my favourite in this episode were the sheep. That scene with the motorcycle pursuing the van, and the sheep on the ladder, was priceless. Another funny scene was the jailbreak, when Wallace slips on the soap, and the sheep come crashing down on him. There is a touch of heartbreak here also, as you feel so sorry for Gromit.

8838,"Vivid, heartfelt, slice of life...early Scorsese; Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974) This is a weird, oddly moving time trip. If you can't quite connect to the characters, or the country wholesome slightly offbeat lower class middle America circa 1973 you won't enjoy it. Because it's about absorbing the mood as a two young people fall in love and find that being in love is hard. Which it is. Ellen Burstyn as a single mom is pretty amazing, very convincing, avoiding glamorous clichÃ©s (not that she isn't beautiful in some Hollywood sense, but she's real). Her counterpart is played by Kris Kristofferson, who isn't really much of an actor, he holds his own most of the time, but in general he drags the movie down. Everyone, including Kristofferson, survives partly because it's about being normal, about the mundane, about being an average American. It's filmed with a surprising beauty--but not the kind that draws attention to itself. There are parts where the camera moves with surprising fluidity, quickly following the characters. Other times, it's just the light that is so beautiful, and the color. Let's give Scorsese credit. He makes it affecting without making it false. A beautiful film. It's modest, somehow, not sensational, but thankfully not. Heartfelt above all.",0.0

50005,"Only Shakespeare could have thought this up...except he didn't; The first thing a person will notice when they watch ""Cures of the Golden Flower"" is its vivid imagery. If you thought ""Speed Racer"" was an eyeful, check this out! It's just as colorful, except that it's all real (or at least it seems to be). If there's any true statement that can be made about Zhang Yimou's 2006 film, it's that it's NEVER dull in the visual sense. It's a pity that the story couldn't have been just as strong. Then we'd have a real masterpiece! In ancient China, trouble is brewing in the royal palace. The royal family has come home to celebrate the Chrysanthemum Festival. The Emperor (Chow Yun Fat) is a power hungry sadist who is slowly poisoning his wife (Gong Li). Her sons (Jay Chou, Yi Liu, Junjie Qin) are in the middle of this increasingly stretched chasm. If this seems like something Shakespeare would write, I was thinking the same thing, but it isn't. The problem with the film is that the storyline is weak, and the characters are sketchily developed. These aren't necessarily bad qualities, but a film that tells a broad story with one-dimensional characters needs to have more bombast. Visually, the film has it. But story-wise, it thinks it's more complex and developed than it is. As a result, the film drags, especially in the middle. At least the acting is good. The film stars two of Asian cinema's shining stars, Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li. Typically, Chow Yun Fat has played the hero type in films (this is especially so for American audiences). Given his background as an action star (he was a favorite of John Woo and one of the stars of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""), one might assume he's incapable of playing a bad guy. Think again. The Emperor is truly evil. He's got a vicious mean-streak a mile long, and no act of sadism is beyond him. Admittedly, Gong Li doesn't have much to do except look crazy, but Li is so talented that she can make even the most boring character the best in the film (there's a reason why she's known as the Asian Meryl Streep). Her sons fare worse. Ye Liu is flat, bordering on bad. Jay Chou manages to be the only likable character in the film, and the only one we really feel for. Junjie Qin is unimportant. However, Man Li, Liu's lover, is adorable, and despite having a secondary role, she has the most visible character arc. Zhang Yimou has a flair for visuals, that much is certain. However, although his films ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"" became art-house hits with the demand for stylized Asian martial arts movies after the success of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" they were both defined by one thing: they lacked a story. With ""Curse of the Golden Flower,"" he's rectified that, at least somewhat. At the rate he's going, in a few films he's going to create a masterpiece. I recommend the film, but note that although the beginning is weak, it gets better. Just stick with it.",0.0

The conclusion is a tragic let down - which may make many uncomfortable about the film. But it as about a real historical tragedy, one that challenges some fundamental assumptions of the principles of American democracy. Objectively, this is true story with artistic embellishments for narrative purposes only - it tells no lies. So objectively and aesthetically it is an impressive film. But it is in the field of morals and politics that this film really shines. This is about Allende, a person who embodied almost a Jeffersonian style of democracy; popular democracy, locally organised. Yes, he was a Marxist, but also a person who had included the national liberation orientation of Boliviar, but also, as mentioned, the Jefferson notion of democracy. Allende _believed_ in democracy. He _believed_ that you could be elected, the State would say, ""OK, because we're fundamentally a democracy and so are you so we'll let you implement a socialist economy"".

Which would be fine except that they all come off as nasty little tyrants, leaving me to wish a plague on all their houses and to sympathise with the poor common soldiers who get slaughtered in the end battle whilst their masters and the director display a total lack of interest in their fate. Everything in this film is done on a big scale, from the running of the palace to the final battle, with a regimentation like clockwork. Again, inhuman and, whilst visually impressive, emotionally blank.

6493,"I...uh, yawn; Slow & Predictable would have been a better title for this movie.  From almost the word ""type"", you pretty much can guess what is going to happen. The pacing of this film is extremely long and drawn out.  I found myself wondering if the actors and director were so hard up for money that they would agree to be in this movie.  Normally, I love Luke Wilson, but he absolutely falls flat in this movie.  Cast against type, there is one scene where he dictates part of the story to Emma as he stands half visible in his bathroom urinating.  Alex may have done that, but I could not believe that Luke Wilson had.  His performance in Royal Tenenbaums was so moving, only to move on to this performance which had me moving toward the theater exit. Kate Hudson seems like any other young local thespian with a flair for accents, whose mother is Goldie Hawn, who occasionally displays a tad of star quality, but overall seems to be capitalizing on and replaying her mother's affectations.  In fact, you'll swear it's Goldie's slinky body gliding from the living room to the kitchen (in oh so many scenes) and even start to wish that it was her.  Sophie Marceau trades her long hair and sensuous style she so breathlessly embodied in Braveheart for a short Louise Brooks-type hair-do.  Unfortunately she also loses some of her trademark ""je ne se quoi"" in the process.  Cloris Leachman makes an almost movie stealing cameo.  Which is sad, because although her performance is hilariously impeccable, the rest of the movie is not.",0.0
19,"A great bad picture!; This is a great film without a plot or a story. Still it is one of the most funny films i know. The reason why i started to really love this film was when i realized how much and how great the actor Jim Carrey can overact. My guess is that this he actually more or less improvise through the entire movie. He play out he's entire register of faces, expressions and one-liners. This is Jim Carrey with out rules, manus or limitations. A must see for the truly Jim Carrey fan.",0.0
19,"Alrighty Than is back and hilarious as always; After Pet Detective there was yet ANOTHER Jim Carrey installment of Ace Ventura and boy was this even more hilarious. Here Jim Carrey's charcther is send to Africa alongside a British explorer to find the missing bat.The opening scenes of Ace Ventura sees him climbing a mountain and meeting Hindu men and his raccoon falls to his death as the harness gets loose. Of course there is more slapstick humor throughout including a scene where Ace is inside a robotic rhino and he has to take off his clothes as the machine got broken down and the only way to get out of the robotic rhino was the get out of his backside,leaving the visitors of the outback of Africa to assume that the so called Rhino was having a baby. That was hilarious. Of course Ace Ventura has to solve the mystery as to where the bat is and who is the culprit again. Overall its not as funny as the first one and Jim Carrey is still Jim Carrey with his whacky over the top image that he had in the 1990s before he got serious with his films. But still if you are a fan of the first film and a fan of Jim Carrey,this isn't a bad film to see on TV or if you get it on DVD. Check it out and see what you think. 5.5/10 Out of 5 stars 2 and a half out of 5.",0.0
5540,"I loved this as a kid.; Inspired by the figures of Greek mythology, ""Clash of the Titans"" tells the tale of Perseus (Harry Hamlin), the mortal son of the god Zeus (who else but Laurence Olivier). In order to meet his destiny, Perseus will be made to face one challenge after another. Zeus and other gods offer assistance at every opportunity, although Perseus's mission will be hindered by the vengeful god Thetis (Maggie Smith), whose son Calibos was turned into a freak for his misdeeds. Yes, ""Clash of the Titans"" '81 is most likely to appeal to the young and young at heart, who should experience a fair amount of wonder. It might not be meaty enough or intense enough for more adult viewers, but overall it's still an engaging, well produced, well shot (on locations in Spain, Italy, and Malta) fantasy adventure. Production design, cinematography, and music are all assets. It does have some mighty fine sequences, especially the taming of the winged horse Pegasus, and the terrifying showdown with the gorgon Medusa, the hideous beast who turns living things to stone if they look at her face. This has a first rate cast of veterans. Olivier is somewhat hammy, but not unbearably so. Also appearing are Claire Bloom, Ursula Andress, Jack Gwillim, Burgess Meredith, Sian Phillips, and Flora Robson. Some don't get to do a whole lot, but Smith is fun as one of the antagonists of the piece. Then-newcomers Hamlin and beautiful Judi Bowker as his love interest Andromeda aren't great actors, but they have enough appeal going for them. Neil McCarthy is quite good, buried under heavy makeup as the evil Calibos. The real star of the movie, though, as anyone would tell you, is special effects legend Ray Harryhausen. His stop motion visuals are once again a joy to behold, and his characters have a charm that even the best CGI can't touch. The one ""immortal"" for whom some viewers may have little to no patience is the mechanical owl Bubo, who's just a little too precious. It may not be terribly faithful to actual Greek mythology, but one shouldn't really expect history lessons from escapist entertainment like this anyway. Seven out of 10.",0.0
8838,"""My romance is gone with the wind""; The early 70s was not a great era for women in film. Women were by and large the losers of the sexual revolution in motion pictures, often turned into objects of desire or the butt of sexist jokes in the now more explicit story lines. Meanwhile the traditional ""women's picture"" had become a thing of the past along just like the biblical epic. Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, was according to one (possibly apocryphal) story, initiated by gangland director Martin Scorsese in response to someone's contention that he couldn't do a movie for women. Whether or not that story is true, it appears this is how the American new wave cinema does a women's picture, whatever such a thing may be. Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore was the debut screenplay of David Getchell. Now, having a picture that tells a woman's story written by a man isn't necessarily a bad thing, but Getchell's lack of experience on the other hand does show him up. Since so much of the runtime is padded out with improvised scenes the story was perhaps a bit thin to begin with. While the picture is undoubtedly told from Alice's point of view, it doesn't really say anything especially profound about women's situations apart from rather obvious things like abusive men not being very nice. The only really significant thing about it in terms of sexual politics is Kris Kristofferson's agreement to go with her to Monterey, an example of the man giving up his dreams for the woman rather than the other way round. This idea was apparently suggested by star Ellen Burstyn, who due to her current stardom had a lot of creative leverage. But, rather disappointingly, the twist is reversed in the final scene. As hinted, it is often the cast who hold the story together. There are some great performances here, although they are great performances that do not stand alone, instead working on the rapport between different characters. Best of these is that between Ellen Burstyn and the young Alfred Lutter. While their scenes together tend to delve into the often tedious world of neo-realist style improvisation, they are naturally so funny together that it really works in endearing us to the characters. Their routines build up a sense of safety and calm, a small but incredibly close family unit. A similar rapport is built up between Bustyn and Diane Ladd, again very realistic despite being obviously more scripted, and injecting the only real strand of maturity into the picture. And what of director Martin Scorsese, film snob favourite and household name to boot? He has a few good ideas, of course facilitating all that improvisation, but by and large he, like Getchell, shows the signs of youth and inexperience. On the one hand, he has the good sense to not let Alice's husband get too personal with camera, only shooting him from behind or in profile so that we don't focus too much on this character who will soon disappear from the story and barely even be mentioned again. But then a little later in the film he really makes us pay attention to some hick barman, making us think for no reason that he is going to become an important character. And as for the camera-work Â– wheeling round all over the place as if the operator was on amphetamines. Some people think that if you move the camera a lot it's ""edgy"" or ""more cinematic"" or something, but unless there is actually a need to move it, it is just a distraction. And hand-held camera-work (which there is a lot of here) doesn't make a scene feel more true-to-life. It's just a big reminder that there's a cameraman in the room. For a movie that was supposed to make a point, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore fails because it doesn't really challenge anything. In terms of male chauvinism it is barely a step-up from women's movies of the 30s and 40s, except that it lacks even the romanticism that made those entertaining. It's not all bad of course, there are some truly lovely moments (Lutton's ""shoot the dog"" story is a highlight), but by and large this is simply another pretentious director's ego movie, amid which whatever heart and soul the story might have had are lost. Whoever it was allegedly said Martin Scorsese couldn't make a ""women's picture"", they were probably right.",0.0

Admittedly the story structure is very story-book like, and some of the acting is not that great, Laurence Olivier looks the part but overacts and while Harry Hamlin looks all heroic as Perseus, his more ""touching"" scenes with Judi Bowker are somewhat anaemic. And the script is not the best either, it has its moments but some of it is cheesy. But there is still plenty to enjoy. First and foremost, the stop-motion special effects are absolutely incredible! Ray Harryhausen creates some truly memorable monsters especially, to this day I am still absolutely terrified of the Gorgon Medussa and the Kraken is also amazing to look at. The scenery, architecture, cinematography and costumes are also fabulous, and the music is superb. The pacing is fine and the direction is efficient. Claire Bloom, Ursula Andress and Maggie Smith give welcome support among the star-studded cast too.

6101,"best example ever of a character making a change; Jack Lemmon portrays a father searching for his son, whom he think has fallen in with a group of naive liberal thinkers. By the end of the movie, Lemmon's character realizes he had fallen in with a group of naive conservative thinkers. This movie portrays the odyssey of the father searching for a missing son in an unstable foreign country. He believes in the powers of the American embassy to protect all Americans. He believes everyone who keeps his nose clean is left alone. He believes in the power of the American people. The movie allows us to feel with him with its careful directing, and to feel for the other characters close to him and his son. We don't choose sides in the movie. We just hold back the tears, knowing that sadness looms, and obviously the father knows sadness looms, too. The religious beliefs, occupation, and history of the father are played down and unimportant. We are left to realize how unimportant it all is when looking for a loved one whom we feel is not in good fortune. A lot of movies claim to change a character in their film, but they're always left to resort to extreme exposition, usually even making the character proclaim that he or she has changed, and more often than not it isn't believable.

6101,"Present and mostly correct; Thought provoking feature from Costa-Gavras, typically taking on a challenging contemporary subject and rendering it effectively and without sensationalism. ""Missing"" takes the viewer on the journey of a loving wife Sissy Spacek and her crusty father-in-law Jack Lemmon as they try to track down the whereabouts of husband/son, who has been ""disappeared"" by the military regime in revolutionary Chile. Shot in clear natural light throughout in realistic locations and often employing native actors for veracity, the director tells his story well but in the end fails to fully engage his audience, in my opinion. The subject matter is a little detached from the ordinary, for one thing, for another, I didn't see the need to give whingeing father Lemmon his attitude problem, which sees him scolding his absent son for going missing, give the hands-tied US embassy representatives way too much leeway in their ineptitude and frequent petty squabbling with Spacek. I didn't quite buy into the husband and wife relationship either, a combination of miscasting and underpowered playing in my view. And yet the story leads you convincingly enough to its downbeat conclusion aided by Vangelis' excellent score and some snappy editing, none more so than in the reconstructions of the conflicting witness perspectives on the abduction itself.

6101,"Propulsive, Real-Life Political Thriller Shows Costa-Gavras and Lemmon at Their Peak; Accomplished Greek-French filmmaker Costa-Gavras has a compelling way of bringing the emotional resonance out of stories with overtly political themes. He hits the mail on the head with this searing indictment of American involvement in the 1973 military coup that ejected Allende from power in Chile. Facts are not discretely presented, even the country in which the story takes place is not disclosed (except for specific references to the cities of Santiago and Vina Del Mar). Yet, Costa-Gavras creates an atmosphere of palpable tension that doesn't let up in this 1982 film, and the unraveling mystery at the heart of the movie echoes the unsettling political situation surrounding the characters. Adapted by Costa-Gavras and Donald Stewart from Thomas Hauser's non-fiction book documenting the true case, the plot focuses on American expatriate Charles Horman whose sudden disappearance in the days after the Pinochet coup brings together two familial adversaries, his wife Beth and his father Ed, who has flown in from New York. Charles and Beth had been leading a vagabond existence with his work in children's animation and their relatively passive support of Allende's reform measures. Charles' back story is revealed in carefully constructed flashback episodes that show him to be curious about the presence of U.S. military personnel in the area. Once he disappears, Ed and Beth seek help from the U.S. Consulate but face a seemingly insurmountable wall of bureaucracy. Frustrated, Ed, a highly conservative Christian Scientist, lashes out at Beth for what he considers her undesirable influence over his son. However, as they absorb the scope of the violence and the culpability of the U.S. government, they bond intractably toward their objective of finding Charles. For once, Jack Lemmon, unafraid to convey his character's prejudices, is able to use his neurotically coiled energy in a suitable dramatic role as Ed. The result is a startlingly raw performance that ranks among his best. Sissy Spacek is terrific as Beth, though her character does not experience as big an arc of self-revelation. In the elliptical flashback role of Charles, John Shea provides solid support, as do Janice Rule as a political activist and a number of familiar TV faces - Melanie Mayron as friend Terry and David Clennon as U.S. consul Phil Putnam, both from ""thirtysomething"", and Joe Regalbuto, Frank from ""Murphy Brown"", playing another Frank, a possible victim of the coup.

6493,"For anyone who ever had a real person as a muse for anything in life: you're in for a treat.; Eventually, this film was one of 2003 biggest misses, box office and general public wise. Why that is so is way beyond me. This heart warming little love story follows Adam Sheldon (Wilson), a young novelist with a very uncomfortable writer's block: he owes a large amount of money to the Cuban mafia and has less than a month to come up with the novel of his life, if he wants to receive the exact amount of cash to give the Cubans, and save his life while at it. In comes Emma (Hudson), a young typist with just the right amount of wit and attitude to confront Adam's daydreaming manners and get him started with what seems as a race against time. From this point on, the film starts moving in two parallel story lines - one showing Alex's real life while Emma types the story he dictates to her; the other shows the story itself, and how what happens to the characters on screen affects it's ongoing development. I won't tell you much from here on out, but the plot sure has some very unique twists and turns, and is shaped in quite an intriguing and charming manner. The obvious romance that sparks up between our lead characters adds to the mix, as imagination and reality playfully bump into each other over and over again. All in all, the movie has quite a bit clichÃ©s from time to time, but than again, what good love story doesn't? Even I, known to be a cynical person now and then, couldn't help but wipe a tear at the very moving finale, and really feel for those characters, both in the general story and inside the plot-within-the-plot ones.

1175,"one didn't expect to have so many cinematographic influences in one genuine story but Jeunet and Caro did it!; I had hammered on this site ""le Fabuleux Destin d'AmÃ©lie Poulain"" (2001) by Jean Pierre Jeunet a few years ago, chiefly because I didn't know anything about his author. Maybe, it's high time I upgraded it and its creator again after I watched this little treasure, ""Delicatessen"" which put him and his co-partner Marc Caro on the map back in 1991. It is one of the most momentous movies of the year. Such a ground-breaking movie couldn't go unnoticed that year. Jeunet and Caro created a quirky universe which shelters a swarm of heterogeneous ideas bridged to give a well-rounded, homogeneous whole. Where do their influences come from? Well, first the tawdry, eerie scenery echoes the one Roman Polanski tapped so well in the spooky ""Le Locataire"" (1976). Then, some exterior shots make the viewer deduce that the authors had German expressionism on their minds when they penned their film. Now, what about the characters? They're colorful, nearly to put it mildly! The brats seem to come from the poetic realism of French cinema in the thirties. Each character or member of a group is so well defined that one could almost talk of subplots that beef the film up with the central story concerning Louison (Dominique Pinon) and Julie. Besides, they're acted by first-class actors who give their characters life and presence on the screen. Jeunet must have been satisfied with their performances since the viewer will see some of them in some of Jeunet's subsequent films, notably Ticky Holgado, Rufus, and especially Jean-Claude Dreyfuss, the best of the batch here and the best butcher French cinema has ever seen since Jean Yanne in Claude Chabrol's masterpiece ""le Boucher"" (1970). Both are monsters of a different kind but the audience feels liking for both of them. Technically, when one construes Jeunet's stylish directing, it's hard not to think of Terry Gilliam's style, notably ""Brazil"" (1985) and through the disquieting angles he uses, things and several human beings take an eerie dimension. Then, another tour-De-force from Jeunet is to have included humor coming from Tex Avery's cartoons and his pithy editing has some Martin Scorsese accents. In spite of some little parts where the interest can wane, the amount is a film that brims with diverse influences on all levels. They are all dovetailed to serve a whimsical story filled with eye-catching details and grisly humor. With this deliciously unsettling black comedy, it's no wonder Jeunet is among a handful of French filmmakers celebrated abroad. According to him, this ground-breaking film and its successor ""La CitÃ© Des Enfants Perdus"" (1995) have been major influences on American cinema since their opening. His moniker is ""the man with two thousand ideas"". I can't remember who gave him this nickname but it's a well-deserved, flattering one.",0.0

I have now seen just about every Wallace and Gromit cartoon and I am still confused by their popularity. I like the animation, and I think the themes are sort of neat (the cheese obsession, for example). But the humor largely escapes me. Things that are obviously intended to be funny do not even make me smile. My lack of understanding aside, the film proved to be critically very well-received. Following in the footsteps of its predecessor ""The Wrong Trousers"", ""A Close Shave"" won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1996. Not only was it given an award, but Shaun, the youngest of the flock of sheep in this feature, proved to be a very popular character and in 2007 was given a TV series, ""Shaun the Sheep"", which has been broadcast worldwide. In 2009, ""Shaun the Sheep"" itself spun off another series, aimed for toddlers, entitled ""Timmy Time"".

5214,"I'd like to think God is just like George Burns in this movie; A very good movie with a nice message. It's not preachy, overly religious or anti-religious. It's more inspirational and shouldn't offend anyone. George Burns is terrific as God taking the form of a kind old man. God (Burns) asks a man (John Denver) in the 1970s to relay His message to the world: that, despite the tough times, ""it can work"" if people get their act together. The man is put in the unenviable position of trying to convince people that he really is God's messenger. In the end, it's not about politics or who's right and who's wrong; it's a friendly reminder that we shape the world in which we live, and we can make it good again. Carl Reiner's film seems like a fairly realistic (if comical) portrayal of the difficulties that would arise if God appeared to only one man in today's modern society. There's a satirical side to it. But the God in this film isn't concerned with who believes and who doesn't. He realizes He can't win over everybody, but He remains in good humor. He watches over the universe in a hands-off manner. Personally I'm not very religious, but Burns is the kind of God I'd like. Great casting. In terms of entertainment value, OH, GOD! might not be the *best* choice for a movie night, but I enjoyed it. I wouldn't want to watch it over and over again, but it's nice to check out once every so often. And I think it's definitely worth seeing once. 7/10",0.0

6493,"Alex & Emma (2003); A message for Rob Reiner: what happened? Twenty years ago you were on top, directing hit after hit after hit: This is Spinal Tap, Stand By Me, The Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally..., Misery, A Few Good Men ... and then things suddenly started getting bad. North? The Story of Us? What went wrong? Well, I'm saddened to report that Reiner's latest feature, Alex & Emma, shows no sign of improvement. But let's try and figure out what exactly DID go wrong here. First of all, the story was full of cliches: a young writer (Luke Wilson) owes two Cuban mobsters $100,000 he squandered on dog races. The mobsters come by, threaten his life, burn his laptop, and inform him that if he doesn't pay up in 30 days, he'll be dead. In comes a beautiful stenographer (Kate Hudson) who's hired to type up Wilson's next book (which he somehow needs to finish within 30 days) and -- of course -- fall in love with him on the side. Ho hum. Aside from the obvious problems, the script (written by Jeremy Leven, who was also responsible for Robert Redford's flop, The Legend of Bagger Vance) is drenched with unoriginality. You can just see Leven trying his damnedest to channel Woody Allen and Nora Ephron, but in the end his writing is lumpy, uneven, and forced. Throughout the movie, Hudson makes various criticisms about Wilson's writing; if only someone could've returned the favor for Leven. As for the casting, Reiner seems to have made his decisions based on the actors' success rather than their compatibility with the roles. Wilson is completely inappropriate as the neurotic hypochondriac (just one of the many ideas stolen from Woody), and as for Hudson, Reiner managed what many thought to be impossible: he made her look unattractive. That's right. He tries to pass her off as a cross between Diane Keaton and Meg Ryan, but no one seemed to realize how uncomfortable Hudson looks in a business suit. From start to finish, Alex & Emma is plagued with bad timing and even worse gags. It wants to be When Harry Met Sally... 2, but has none of the insight and is completely devoid of entertainment. Another big mistake made by Leven is his use of the story-within-a-story concept; while not necessarily a bad technique, it should only be used when the one story is actually good enough to demand a second one. In Leven's case, one was more than enough. The characters are just photocopies of stereotypes, and they're dull ones at that. While watching Alex & Emma, I had a hard time deciding which was worse: the actual plot of the movie or that of the book Wilson is writing. Although I was never able to make up my mind, I wouldn't recommend you try it, either. The most insightful line of the movie comes when Wilson (as a character in his book) tells Hudson (as one of her multiple characters in the movie, each more irritable than the last), ""You struck oil. Stop drilling."" I'd like to forward that advice to Reiner. Afterall, we'll always have Harry and Sally; as for Alex and Emma, let's try our best to forget this incident ever happened. SIDE-NOTE: If you ARE unfortunate enough to see this movie, you can at least try to entertain yourself by spotting Michael Rappaport's cameo. Grade: D",0.0

Nice to see a story work on different levels, which makes it new and more entertaining each time you view it.

745,"One of very few movies that actually would deserve a spot in the TOP 250...; Oh, if only this great, great movie wasn't so short! WALLACE AND GROMIT: A CLOSE SHAVE is one of the best and most original movies ever made. Every hilarious and charming character is made out of clay, so it takes the committed claymators a horribly long time to film everything, but boy does it look good. The story is about Wallace (voiced by the incomparable Peter Sallis, and the equally good Claes MÃ¥nsson in the dubbed Swedish version) and his clever dog, Gromit, who usually has to clean up the messes his master gets himself into. Working as window cleaners, Wallace falls in love with Wendolene, who sells wool together with her dog, Preston, who isn't very fond of Gromit. After Gromit gets life in prison after being set up by Preston, it soon turns out that Wendolene and her dog are up to no good. The movie has the best plot twist since perhaps ""I am your father"", so I won't give it away. The voice acting is passionate and great, and the claymation is also beautiful. The unique characters and story are very imaginative, the cutest character being Shaun the sheep (who wears a sweatshirt made of his own fur after Wallace accidentally shaved him). A short, but very tragic, funny, exciting, and touching work of art by the incomparable Nick Park and the Aardman animation studios.

However, she is still devastated when her emotionally abusive husband is killed. She decides to sell off everything, pack up the rest and drive to California with her son Tommy. She tries to get singing gigs along the way which she abandoned when she was younger. She sleeps with Ben (Harvey Keitel) but he turns out to be abusive and married. In Tucson, she takes a waitress job in a diner owned by short-order cook Mel (Vic Tayback). Flo (Diane Ladd) and Vera (Valerie Curtin) are the other waitresses. Alice falls for diner customer David (Kris Kristofferson). Tomboy Audrey (Jodie Foster) gets Tommy into trouble. Ellen Burstyn is an amazing actress. She's asked to play a complicated character that grows and changes. She's a meek housewife at the start. She struggles with everything especially her son. She's a tough cookie. The only thing truly missing from her is a good singing voice. This is from Martin Scorsese. Without Harvey Keitel and Jodie Foster, it wouldn't occur to me that he's the director. He's coming off of 'Mean Streets'. This is not about gangsters. It's about a single mom. He does get the lower class grittiness and he leaves the single mom characterization to Burstyn. Diane Ladd is also terrific as the loud-mouth Flo. The plot does meander like Alice's journey. The shooting is documentary style. It's not surprising that the diner turns into a TV show.

But is the new lodger as innocent a chicken as he appears? Wallace finds himself part of a major jewel robbery Â– can Gromit return in time to save him? The second of the adventures of Wallace & Gromit sees the animation greatly improve from the brilliant but very amateurish 'A grand day out' and the comedy extremely sharp and funny. The basic plot is a little silly but very well crafted considering this is a short film Â– I wish that all those other 'proper' films that have been a complete waste of time to watch had plots this clever and imaginative. It is also absolutely a wonder to watch Â– even when I wasn't laughing I was easily charmed by the wit and imagination of the whole thing. The animation is superb, Wallace is as good as ever and Gromit is much more fully developed and is easily the star. His physical comedy is brilliant, with the slightest twitch animated so well that we fall about laughing. The penguin however threatens to steal the show as well as the jewel. How can a Plasticine penguin with a glove on its head that likes listening to organ music be threatening? Well it can Â– here he snaps his head round and stares with such menace that it's actually frightening! They all work well together but Gromit takes the film by a nose. With all those brain dead kids cartoons around on TV this should be treasured.

6101,"Gavras,Lemmon,Vangelis ...:""Missing""; The immeasurably beautiful score adds much to the film's mystery;and,while the characters overstate their political creedsÂ—as the things go with the political movies,and as was fitted for a crisis situation like that chosen by Gavras hereÂ—the director fortunately understates the truths about life,to a greater effect.Gavras' craftsmanship is indeed potent and extremely refined,in the most UN-intruding way.Missing is praiseworthy, in Lemmon's list of movies, in another way tooÂ—as an unconventional and,let us use the ""A"" word Â…, art-house film;I mean Lemmon had not many opportunities to show up in an ambitious art-house drama by an European director .Missing brings a fine variation in his palette of movies.I did not know it before I saw the movie,of course,but I longed ,mutely, to see Lemmon in such a movie, be it a CCG political drama.In Missing there are many things to be tasted immensely. (But from now on I'll refrain from throwing with superlatives Â…). I would rather say that Missing is not a movie made to elicit loveÂ—for either the director (CCG) or its charactersÂ—but respect, esteem and human appreciation.Gavras crafted in Missing severalÂ—many inspired sequences, many pieces where the facts shown on screen are as if inspirited with a magic fascination, with a hugely lyrical charm (it is felt as huge,as I just said,precisely because it is understated and discreet and natural, in no way over-imposed, in no way extrinsic, but twinkling within the core of an amazingly perceived reality Â…),with an inspirited and simultaneously finely distanced approachÂ—this refined quality succeeds from the beginning of ""Missing"" in creating an atmosphere that delights. Some things can be said about Lemmon as wellÂ—he impresses by a firmness, a force that empower his natural, charming, gentlemanly distinction.During the story,his character,this HormanÂ—gains progressively depth.This is wondrous to behold,this transformation,that Lemmon makes very evident and tangible and defining.The way this transformation occursÂ—and comes forth from Â…--inside.It is easy to conceive it Â…--but to realize it on screen,within the boundaries of a given script Â….To turn so naturally a natty bourgeois into a much more interesting person Â….Lemmon transforms what otherwise could have been the worst of political sermons into a surprising human;notice,please that his sense of balance keeps him strictly and highly effective from caricaturing his Horman character;in no scene does Horman appear as a petty bourgeois or as a ridiculous narrow-minded laughable caricature.We may sense, yes,when Gavras thinks that Horman is wrongÂ—and when Gavras thinks that Horman, after changing his mind,got right-minded.Yet,Lemmon never looses control of his character and maintains it within the coordinates of a sober and straightforward realism. In this sense,Missing is an interesting conjunctionÂ—of two highly refined and essential artistic stylesÂ—that of Gavras,and that of Lemmon.Both these styles tend toward minimalismÂ—a refined and simultaneously energetic minimalism,that does not reduce, but concentrates and reaches a welcome straightforward simplicityÂ—without a single trace of simplistic propaganda and vehemence. At the beginning of Missing I was pretty inclined Â…or rather prepared for a small role of LemmonÂ—I was prepared for one of those entirely honorary and decorative roles that actors of a certain age and/or fame use to get (I knew,of course,that he was awarded for this performance,that the movie was quite praised and hyped;yet Â…);but that was not the case.The whole movie,on the other hand,is much more than the political propaganda that the Missing's poster announces or promises:""Horman thought that being an American Â…,etc."".I would define Missing's merits by the freshness ,by Gavras' feel for the photogenic of the locations,and by a certain lyricism and contemplative approach that tones down the vehemence of a political stance.I want to mention exactly this:that Missing is firstly a piece of lyricism, and not of political criticism.Its lyrical and human tones are its main merit.Also,it is completely deprived of any vulgarityÂ—cinematographic vulgarity,I mean,like cheap sensationalism, etc.. One might dislike the indeed ugly '70s look of some of these journalists,or the implied Bohemian crap and the bunch of subversive dedicated altruist CommunistsÂ—fortunately,the movie keeps always beyond this stuff. One more word about the scoreÂ—this is one of Vangelis' finest scores,and what is remarkable today is the subtlety and distinguished charm and the subtle fascination of such a beautiful music;I happen to be an admirer of Dead Can Dance's To Zucchabar (Gladiator).Still,Vangelis' superiority is obvious from the beginningÂ—the man works on a completely different scale.I discovered his music in '93,when I was 15;there are a few albums I listened to quite oftenÂ—his ""1492"" score,and Antarctica,Mythodea,Voices and even some of his eerie vocal music (that J&V stuff Â…).Well,the music he made for Missing certainly ranks with these.But I fear my considerations about Vangelis might interest you even less that those about Lemmon's role.There are many,many beauties in Gavras' film;its atmosphere is delightful.Enjoy!",0.0

8838,"early Scorsese hints at greater things to come; A rare entry in the Martin Scorsese canon by virtue of the fact that the protagonist is a female, 'Alice' nonetheless shows sings of the elements that would come to define the Scorsese signature. The camera is constantly in motion. At one point the camera steadicams from a restaurant, out into the yard, then back into a toilet, a progenitor for the now legendary steadicam restaurant shot in Goodfellas. Similarly, the cutting between two waitresses having a heart-to-heart in the loo, while chaos reigns in their absence in the diner, provides the template for the editing pattern used to such effect in the making-the-sauce/ selling-the drugs-&-guns scene at the end of Goodfellas (still Scorsese's best film, imho). There is explosive violence, Harvey Keitel showing a glimpse of the flawed brutes that would become more of a Scorsese concern, portrayed in his movies by De Niro, Joe Pesci, Daniel Day Lewis, and Jack Nicholson. There are laugh out loud moments, mostly to do with Ellen Burstyn's son, possibly the most annoying kid on celluloid. During the car journey, when the kid whines and complains incessantly at his mother, you would have to be a saint not to want to leave him by the side of the road. Which, of course, is what she does later, her immense regret stunningly portrayed when she cries in her car by the side of the road, the muted sound somehow amplifying the emotion. Excellent acting all round, with special mention to Jodie Foster and Dianne Ladd. The script is crisp and the dialogue always right on the money (watch the pitch perfect speech of contrition Kristoffensen makes at the counter in the diner to win Alice back). The feel-good ending is something we do not often get from Scorsese, but it fits here. Some have attacked the ending for endorsing the view that a woman needs a man to be happy, but in fact it plays out as the man who needs the woman to be happy (he offers to give up everything for her, not the other way around). It does date the film - I can't imagine such an ending in the days of No Country for Old Men. In short, 'Alice' is a very good film for movie fans everywhere, and Scorsese aficionados in particular.",0.0

The critic must have walked out and missed the important information given after that. They did not come from a country where you can put people like that in jail. Apart from the political tract of the film, Missing is about the tragedy of a man finding out who his son is and how much they had in comman after it is beyond his ability to make amends. He is a conservative who defends the ""very good way of life"" America has to his son's traumatised and despairing girlfriend played by an inspired Spacek. Later a broken man, his own words are cruelly thrown back in his face by those allegedly involved in his son's disappearance in protection of American business interests.

Starting with the jarring juxtaposition of the red-lit opening sequence of young Alice with the reality of present day, this movie is a visual tour de force. In the first few minutes Scorsese establishes Alice's need for companionship and her love of music while painting a poignant portrait of this little family. Essentially this is a road movie and its ending has been commented on in several posts as a Hollywood sell out. I don't see that. It is a very bittersweet ending, with Alice having to give up the singing part of her dream for the time being.

19,"Top shelf comedy; I've been saving this movie for years for some kind of urgent need for a laugh emergency. But, it was on cable last night and since I was worn out and not interested in exerting enough energy to push a button on the remote, I resigned myself to the fact that perhaps I needed it and had saved it long enough. It was so funny I was practically hysterical and had suddenly lost that feeling of being too tired to move. Anyone who used to watch In Living Color can attest to Jim Carrey being a master of physical comedy. I used to watch him do utterly amazing stuff on that show and looked forward, every week, to seeing what he'd do next. Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls is, unquestionably, Jim Carrey at his very best. That goes for the entire crew of the movie. I think many people tend not to notice but there are huge differences between the quality of a comedy such as When Nature Calls and the rather half-hearted movies that just don't work very well and are not very funny as a result. Some of this can be directly attributed to how well the director frames scenes and how well they maintain the energy. To how well the writers, director of photography and the film editor did their jobs. With When Nature Calls, you have all of these bases covered in spades. It's truly well made in front of, as well as behind, the camera. Carrey never loses his momentum in this movie. He goes over the top quite frequently. Unlike some other comedic actors, though, he seems to almost always know when to stop. And when to play it cool, although that doesn't happen very often. I don't know how much of the movie is scripted and how much was ad libbed, but whatever the combination, it works beautifully. It's almost always hilarious and the camera always seems to be in just the right place. Exquisite production. Ace Ventura is a force of nature and all the world's a straight man for him, apparently. No one is safe. He is constantly pulling someone's chain. Particularly the bad guys who he always has squarely in his sights. I would definitely recommend this movie to a family. The small children, particularly the boys, will get a big kick out of it. It's disgusting from time to time and drifts effortlessly in to the scatological here and there but it's all good. One tip: when Ace gets to the African tribe's village, that might be a good time to leave the room for a few minutes. You're welcome.",0.0

Disappointingly lightweight WHEN HARRY MET SALLY-ish romantic comedy, especially with Reiner's stroke of novelty and use of charm, has Hudson in five roles with not all of them genuine. Deceitful hypochondriac (Wilson) who writes books for a living gets himself in a jam when he has to make a $100 grand for a pair of Cuban Mafia loan sharks in thirty days by writing another work of fiction so he doesn't wind up six feet under. So he hires an opinionated stenographer (Hudson) to help him sculpt a love triangle on paper that then percolates into a real-life romance budding between the two. Though both stories soon come together, the trouble with the film is that it flips pages back and forth from its outside story set in contemporary Boston to a New England island set in the 1920s for its story within a story, which is rich in tedium. A line spoken from Hudson about Wilson's fictional triangle is exactly like the film itself; the story shoves itself into a corner, where it has nowhere to go except a typically old-fashioned and too quickly enfolded finale. What redeems the film is its endearing leads and airy sense of romance, and occasionally a witty one-liner. Running Time: 96 minutes and rated PG-13 for language and sexual content. **",0.0

6493,"Interesting concept blown by lack of chemistry; Rob Reiner has been on a slump. Since ""The American President,"" he has failed to make a really good romantic comedy. That slump will continue with ""Alex & Emma,"" a movie with good ideas, but lacks the execution. The biggest problem is there is ZERO chemistry between the two leads. Honestly, if they'd had two leads with better chemistry (such as Hugh Jackman and Ashley Judd of ""Someone Like You"") the movie would've scored much higher. Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson are enjoyable to watch, but there are zero sparks between them. The movie does seem a little long, and the build-up is awfully slow. It also isn't very funny, which hurts. If you were planning on seeing this, go rent ""Two Weeks Notice"" or ""Someone Like You"" instead and watch how a good romantic comedy should be done. This will be worth a look once it hits DVD. Final Score: 4.9 out of 10 (Unfunny comedy with zero chemistry)",0.0
1148,"Trousers Syndrome; This is the fruition of Park's movie-making paradigm...a fully developed self-referential world of cinematic ideas. Again, Park the inventor creates the movie's mechanics by having Wallace, the inventor within, create the movie's mechanics: this time, by constructing the 'Techo-Trousers'. The noir twist is, another inventor within steals and co-opts the mechanics of the movie to toy with the protagonist...a brilliant derivation from Hitchcock, and other movies in Hitch's tradition such as ""Pacific Heights"" (the renter moves in and takes over the 'mechanics' by taking over the house). Layered onto this, we have the first full use of Gromit as the detective who 'discovers' the narrative for us as we go along. He is the comic relief and the source of the movie's own self-awareness, this time by being fully aware of and acknowledging the camera's existence. The ending borrows from forerunners such as ""The Great Train Robbery"", ""The Great Escape"", and ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"".

A little skeptical at first, Jerry is eager to give it a shot. He faced some sharp criticism by everyone around him. Not even his wife(Terri Garr) was supportive. In some spots, she was. Jerry discovered his own job has been dishonest to their customers. And a respected preacher(Paul Sorvino) who sues Jerry is exposed by God as a ""hypocrite"", and should be selling shoes. In the courtroom scene, I liked the part when He's sworn in ""to help me Me"". Jerry held his grounds against a group of theologians. The miracles have been provided. After all he has gone through, he has paid the price when he loses his job at the supermarket. Only God cared for him. Jerry would have been a lot happier working at a more honest supermarket anyway. Believing His Words was a must have for Jerry. Great cast, great story. Awe inspiring, this movie is a true gem. Believe my friend, believe. 5 stars.",0.0
19,"Great sequel!; Despite most views of this movie, I thought it was just as good as (and in some aspects better than) the original.  Of course there was a lot  of recycled humor, but there was also a lot of original humor too.  I was a little bummed to find out that Courteney Cox wasn't returning in the second installment, but they did just fine without her.  I doubt it will happen, but I would love to see an Ace Ventura 3 someday. I thought the scene where Ace is trapped inside the animatronic rhino was the funniest scene in the movie, but the film is filled with other great scenes too.  I also loved the fact that he is a lover of all animals, except Bats.  I thought that was such a funny idea for the character.  I mean, what does that say about bats if a lover of all animals can't even stand them and finds them revolting.  Just thinking about it makes me laugh.  I just love the irony I guess.  Anyhow, there isn't much more I can say about this film other than if you liked ""Pet Detective"", you should see ""When Nature Calls"".  ""Bumble-Bee Tuna"", -Chris",0.0
6493,waste of time; Alex Sheldon (Luke Wilson) is suffering from writer's block and hounded by thugs looking to collect on gambling debts. He needs $100k in 30 days. He needs to finish his book before Wirschafter (Rob Reiner) is willing to pay him the money. He hires stenographer Emma Dinsmore (Kate Hudson) to help finish his book about a love triangle. This is a horribly unfunny movie from director Rob Reiner. Luke Wilson is not charming here and yet the movie expects him to be boyishly charming. He is pretty whiny. Kate Hudson is annoying rather than be her winning self. Reiner has done something with high difficulty. He has taken two charming rom-com actors and made a joyless romance. The combative nature of their relationship should be romantic heat but their arguments annoyed the heck out of me. The worst is the book within the movie. I couldn't care less about his poorly written story.,0.0
1148,"About as good as you can get.; Wallace and Gromit's first short, ""A Grand Day Out"" was very impressive in it's looks, but short on plot and dialogue. This one is better in every department. Both Wallace and Gromit are better developed, and this felt like it could've been a full length feature, though it worked perfectly well at it's 30 minute length. To get some extra money, Wallace rents out one of his rooms to a burglar penguin. Wallace's newest invention might be needed for the penguin's maniacal plan. The scenes with Wallace are fun, but the ones with Gromit are even better. Gromit is a dog, and manages to show amazing emotion and through motions is extremely amusing, as is the silent penguin. The music perfectly accentuates the action, and this is a really an animated masterpiece, and definitely the best of Wallace and Gromit's movies. My rating: **** out of ****. 30 mins.",1.0

19,"It's Just Plain Funny; Is it dumb? Well, it's definitely low-brow, but it also has some gags that are undeniably clever. Is it racist? Yeah, a little, but it's also satirizing old stereotypes about ""Dark Africa."" Is it immature and and gross and sophomoric and over-the-top? Yes. Yes, it is. But someone (well, me) once said the only thing comedies have to be is funny. And this movie is dang funny. Need I remind anybody of the scene where Ace insists on dropping a slinky down the hundreds of steps leading up to a Buddhist temple? (""It was RIGHT there!"") Or the slideshow in which Ace's hand appears to greedily devour a poacher's crotch? That's just hilarious! The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't settle for outlandish set-ups that only seem to be jokes. This movie gets full bang for its comedic buck. Do we have a fight with a crocodile presented in-and-of-itself as humor? No! In a lesser film, perhaps. But Ace Ventura goes the extra mile, bringing us childish schoolyard taunts (""Stop hittin' yourself! Stop hittin yourself!"") And is it enough to have Ace chasing the villain through the jungle in a monster truck? No - he actually pulls up next to him and utters a bon mot worthy of Groucho. Also, where did that monster truck come from?! The sheer resolve not to explain the truck's presence is a sublimely satirical dig at movies that might place monster trucks in the jungle just for cheap, lazy wackiness. This movie is anything but lazy. Jim Carrey, like no actor before him, pulls out all the stops as Ace Ventura. Is he milking things? Oh sure. He's milking things like Paganini milked the violin, or like Michelangelo milked the Sistine Chapel. He's inventing a manic persona so complete and fully realized, that it transcends standard comedy and achieves something mystical and poetic and truthful. And that's how it keeps from being annoying. This film is too casually dismissed because it looks like a terrible movie. I was hesitant to watch it. But maybe, years and years from now, it will achieve the kind of subversive cult-film status it deserves.",0.0
8838,"Good early effort from a great director...; Not Scorsese's best, but an interesting effort.  The Stappert IMDb review is very good.  I would also note that Burstyn, Ladd and Lutter are very strong. Jodie Foster is fascinating in her brief role, as one compares her appearance here with her personal history and how public her life has been. Scorsese has made a film with some likeable characters (unlike much of his later work).  He uses music well, although the soundtrack in the early part of the film reflects some poor choices.  There is some good camera work here as well that presages later films such as ""Goodfellas.""  (He has several interesting shots of bar fronts and interiors.)  Harvey Keitel ALMOST fools the audience here, and Kristofferson is...well, Kristofferson. I saw this on an old videocassette, and it seems to have had the sound edited and some cuts made to the print, so I rated it a ""7.""  It is definitely NOT a comedy, and is worth watching with ""An Unmarried Woman."" It's unfortunate that the insipid TV show resulted from this much stronger original effort. One additional comment/complaint.  Like ""An Unmarried Woman,"" men seem to fall into two classes here:  Complete psychos or s***s, or men who have some faults but seem to be open and almost desperate to possess the central female character.   Is this a true reflection on the gender, or just another Hollywood convention?",0.0

If you like Jim Carrey and you didn't like Dumb and Dumber as much as the first Ace Ventura (like me) then you'll welcome this work from his portfolio. Granted, like Dumb and Dumber there is a mucous scene which could have been funnier if they had stopped just short of showing it because you already got the joke before it happened (as with the Fat B**tard stool sample scene in Austin Powers 2). What I enjoyed most about the movie was that they expanded on Ace's exposure to upper class conservatives (or twits as the Pythons would call them) which sprouts a myriad of jokes and humiliations that Jim Carrey performs so well. While I find the first Ace Ventura movie difficult to remember (I own it as well) this sequel has enough enjoyable moments that I think of it often enough to put in the VCR. If you long for more great expressions and hilarious dialog from Jim Carrey, this movie has it!",0.0
8838,"The Wizard of Oz; Director Martin Scorsese begins ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" with two of its best scenes. In the first, a parody of Hollywood musicals, a young Alice Hyatt finds herself skipping across what looks like a discarded ""Wizard of Oz"" sound stage. She's singing along to Alice Faye's ""You'll never know"", a moody song about love and loss. It's an apt song choice because, for the rest of the film, it is precisely Alice's failure to actualise this fantasy image of herself as a successful singer and star of MGM musicals, that leads to her dissatisfaction. Immediately after this highly stylised introductory sequence, Scorsese flashes forward several decades. ""All the way from Memphis"" booms on the soundtrack (a song about the loss of a musical instrument), Scorsese's camera racing across the rooftops of countless suburban homes before zeroing in on one open window (pure Orson Welles). Inside sits Alice, hunched over a sewing machine. Scorsese's point is clear: The dream has faded, the instrument long gone. Instead of a singer, Alice has become a widower and mother, stuck in a series of dreary jobs and abusive relationships. And so the rest of the film proceeds along similarly literal lines. Alice jumps from job to job, man to man, trying to scrape enough money to survive, all the while dreaming she were a famous singer. She has arguments with her son, arguments with co-workers and conflicts with abusive men. In the end, she meets the charming Kris Kristofferson, whom she naively thinks is the man of her dreams. He will take her into his life, take care of her, and give her the space she needs to pursue her creative dreams. Or so she thinks. Scorsese inserts enough clues to imply that Kris is just as abusive as all of Alice's other men. The film may be nothing more than a giant bag of clichÃ©s, but Scorsese's injects enough energy into the picture to make it entertaining. His camera is always moving, rocketing back and forth like a gazelle on cocaine. He uses rock songs and sad tunes to alternate between moments of energy and desperation, his characters bombastic and permanently on the edge of explosion. There's no poetry in Scorsese's world, only rock and roll, youthful exuberance and violence. Still, it's infectious. Where the film fails is in it's ""ideas"". After the success of ""The Exorcist"", actress Ellen Burstyn was given free reign to produce a picture. She intended to make a ""woman's picture"" that showcased contemporary female empowerment. To direct the film - which she championed as a ""feminist statement"" - Burstyn sought director Brian De Palma, who'd recently made ""Sisters"". De Palma, however, advised her to turn to his friend Martin Scorsese. But though it pretends to portray ""female empowerment"", ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" falls into the same trap that all these genre films do. Firstly, it portrays all men as scheming oafs, abusive, lazy and violent. Secondly, Alice may be a strong woman, juggling job, sex and son, but she spends the film looking for the warm comfort of a man. She cannot function without one. She needs the security, financial and psychological strength, that one provides. Thirdly, though Alice blames ""life"" for her dreams failing to materialise, the film makes it clear that it is Alice's own insecurities, her own problems, that stand in her way. Hardly feminism. The result is that, for all its slick direction, ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" never develops beyond those pseudo-working class movies that pander to the usual ""freedom of the road"" fantasies, while secretly delivering happiness through homebound security, a docile male, and the comforts of lower-class work bonding. ""Mother"", still defined as the sacrifice of one owns identity for the sake of the child, is still the highest goal. 7.9/10 Â– This is a fast paced drama directed with bravura by Scorsese. Still, the film leaves us with nothing more than the usual Hollywood feminist clichÃ©s. That is, feminism equals women who have callous sex, women who raise kids on their own, women who realise men are all violent beasts and women who can be sexy but also motherly. But one wonders how much control Scorsese had on the film. His opening and closing scenes are parodic and blatantly poking fun at Alice. Scorsese and Burstyn seem to be making two completely different films. Or rather, Scorsese is undermining Emma's naivety. Because of this, the film works best as a sort of ironic remake of ""The Wizard of Oz"". Consider this: a tornado-like camera move pulls Alice out of her idyllic childhood and dumps her in modern suburbia. Her husband dies, she heads off down a yellow brick road, discovers that its lined with, not gold, but seedy bars and motels, becomes involved with men who lack brains, heart or courage, before being dumped back down on a farm. The film even replaces the flying monkeys of ""Wizard of Oz"" with a joke about monkeys and men getting their balls bitten off. Neat. Worth one viewing",0.0
6493,Ahhhhh; This had to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. It looked good in the previews but that was about it. All they did was have Kate Hudson dress up in different wigs and use different accents. It wasn't even really funny. Very listless and dragged out.,0.0
6101,"Hats off to Costa-Gavras and Jack Lemmon; Although I've heard quite a lot about Costa-Gavras I've never seen one of his films before now. I also can't remember seeing Jack Lemmon in anything either, even though he's an acting legend. On the strength of ""Missing"" I'm going to keep an eye out for them both. Although the film has been criticised for its mixture of fact and fiction it is a compulsively watchable film, that entertains, moves and provokes. Lemmon is superb as the American father searching for his son (Shea) in Chile, after the 1973 coup. The ever excellent Spacek is Shea's wife and the strong screenplay provides them with meaty roles that unfold as well as the plot. However the most credit has to go to Costa-Gavras who brilliantly handles the whole film and creates a strong sense of tension that borders on fright in his depiction of the bullet torn streets of Chile, especially in the first 20 minutes and holds our fascinating right to the highly provocative twist at the end. 9/10",0.0

745,"Better than A Grand Day Out, but slightly lesser than The Wrong Trousers; Wallace & Gromit made a likable debut with A Grand Day Out. The film had some problems to iron out, but by the time of The Wrong Trousers, Nick Park had gained a command of the stop-motion process, and captured lightning in a bottle. The Oscar-winning success of the film turned Wallace & Gromit into household names. Aardman were quick to find the funds for a third instalment. With every Wallace & Gromit film, the animators refine they're craft a little bit further. They become more ambitious. The plots run even deeper. And the animation becomes ever more polished. This is all certainly clear to see in A Close Shave. The Wrong Trousers has a slight edge over the film, but A Close Shave is yet another lively, hilarious Wallace & Gromit adventure. A Grand Day Out had a giddy innocence to it. But it was obvious from The Wrong Trousers that Nick Park was taking the characters into darker areas. A Close Shave goes even deeper, and is further proof that the Wallace & Gromit series is now in a very different place from where it first started. Wallace & Gromit are into a new business venture, window-cleaning. Wallace falls for Wendoline, the owner of a wool-shop he (or rather Gromit) does the windows for. But Wendoline has a secret. A secret that ropes Wallace & Gromit into an adventure with sheep rustlers and a dog who is not the good shepherd he appears. Every film in the series develops an increasing maturation. Not just in the way they're made, but also in the way they're written. Its difficult to remember at this point that A Close Shave was made by the same team of animators who produced the light romanticism of A Grand Day Out. Aardman are working from an all new rule book. The Wrong Trousers had a seriousness to it over its predecessor. But it took some time into the film before we began to notice. With A Close Shave, its impossible not to see it. Heck, the film even abandons Julian Nott's signature theme music, and dives into the storyline. Right from the opening frame, an unmistakable dourness permeates the picture. Wendoline and Preston pull up outside Wallace and Gromit's house in the dead of night. The way Preston is dressed, you know he's got crime on his mind. His face is stern, no-nonsense. Right away we know he's the villain of the film. We need to remind ourselves here that we're watching a Wallace & Gromit picture. That doesn't mean the film isn't funny. We get the usual sidesplitting scenes with Wallace's inventions. Especially good is Wallace gearing up for work with chutes and levers, while Gromit just sits in a sidecar waiting for Wallace to finish up. This film is also a departure from the others in the series by having the first character, other than Wallace, who can speak. Anne Reid gives a sympathetic voice to Wendoline's plight, and never comes between the delightful double-act of Wallace and Gromit, always the heart of the series. One of the best things about The Wrong Trousers was the surprising poignancy Nick Park managed to make us feel for Gromit, watching Feathers McGraw slowly oust him from Wallace's house. He pulls off the same trick again when Preston frames Gromit for sheep-rustling. Seeing Gromit sitting in a jail cell without a friend in the world is a raw, emotional moment. Especially when he gets a present, a 5000 piece jigsaw puzzle, and he starts crying. Its impossible not to feel real sadness for the character. A Close Shave ups the action quotient too. Everyone remembers the train set chase in The Wrong Trousers, but Nick Park and his animation team have gone all out to top that sequence with even more dizzying thrills and spills. Gromit's sidecar going over a cliff and turning into an aeroplane is just as exciting as anything in a James Bond film. And A Close Shave gets itself together for a marvellous climax, when Preston is revealed to be a robot underneath. Gleefully cribbing The Terminator, the sequence with all of the characters on a conveyor belt trying to avoid being crushed is as breathless as it is funny. One criticism you could make of the film is that it isn't as tight as The Wrong Trousers. The film makes many swoops and dives, and the plot line is an engaging one. But A Close Shave takes several viewings to get a proper grasp of the narrative, meaning its not as dramatically taut as The Wrong Trousers, or as instantly accessible as A Grand Day Out. We would have to wait a staggering ten years for the next instalment, Wallace & Gromit's feature film debut, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, a delightful story just as engaging as any of the shorts. A Close Shave is yet another worthy addition to the canon with plenty for everyone. And look out for Shaun the Sheep, who steals every scene just by being in it.",1.0

5214,"He Suggested You Sell Shoes; Spoilers Ahead: To give this movie credit, ask yourself how difficult it is to do a religious comedy without offending specific religions, or, being sacrilegious? The movie dances about the difficulties often doing a pirouette. Truly, Burns is great here, this is a consistently witty movie having lots of fun with televangelists. Sorvino steals the movie as a crooked, greedy television evangelist whom Burns' God tells Jerry to tell to get a real job, maybe selling earth shoes but shut up. I understand people of specific religions being put off by the film, but, truthfully notice Burns' does not deny a Day Of Judgment,""If you mean a doomsday, there is going to be a lot of yelling and screaming and I don't need that any more than you do."" The movie follows God choosing a lowly grocery assistant manager to be His next messenger. The movie's Theism is intended to transcend the gulfs between all particular religions. This is the point of God telling Landers that He is not into religion; He is bigger than that, He is everyone's God. The movie follows the perils of Landers trying to bring his message to people with realistic consequences like losing his job, becoming a pariah and being perceived as a raving lunatic. It is unrelentingly endearing with Landers presenting God's card to people never grasping how bizarre it is to others. The movie starts light, maintains its lightness until the end, where it grows more serious with Lander's facing jail for slandering Sorvino's crooked money bags evangelist. The message of God's love is here, yes detractors, the cost of Goodness is attenuated to keep the movie's tone light. Even on this point, notice the suffering Landers and his family undergo. His Faith is attacked, he is fired, ostracized and ridiculed but he remains true to God. Burns never gave a better performance, the writing features great trenchant dialog poking fun at those who think, because they are giving the invocation at the Super Bowl, they stand above all others. Yes, it will offend Christians, as it did in 1977. My parents were picketing this for the line,""Jesus was my son, Muhammad was my son, Moses was my sonÂ…,"" no, it is important not to miss the movie's highlighting the commonalities of all religions. The love of each other, Faith that courageously defies, sacrifice for one's Faith these are all here but done lightly. Denver, a great singer but an average actor, is carried in most of his scenes by much more talented actors: Burns, Sorvino, Garr and Hughes. I am a Theist, a Theistic Existentialist to be precise, it conveys the core ideas of Theism well and comically. Yes, if you believe that one particular religion is correct and all others are Evil, do not watch the movie, it will offend you. When you watch it over notice how, though moral duties are lightened, Jerry's sufferings for his Faith are not. The suspense of the movie builds to his almost incarceration with God saving Jerry at the last minute. Encouraging people to think about God is never a bad thing, though it is admittedly humanistic in this,""you're on your own, I gave you everything you need,"" no movie is perfect. It is funny while making its point; this is the movie that put Sorvino on the map. For me, the points about the costs of Faith, the separation of hypocrisy, as a refutation of the verity of spirituality, make this worth owning. The whole point of the Sorvino story and God's disgust with him is to show you a pithy refutation of Neil Jordan's The Borgias. See, if every single pope were Evil and corrupt, you have not touched one moral law. Morality does not rise or fall predicated upon perfect practitioners. To be human is to be corrupt, morality is not refuted by showing its adherents being flawed, take some logic Neil! The spirituality, while light, is still of substance. It is all done with wit and humor as only George Burns could do it. ""Sit down sonny, I've answered enough questions."" It was released before Star Wars and was drowned beneath that tsunami at the box office. Also, many people, like my parents, took great umbrage at it. It truly is a witty presentation of Theism: The theory that God is beyond all human attempts to confine Him in a single religion. It will make you chuckle, guaranteed. Q.E.D.

1223,"To The Moon Wallace; Aardman Animation started as a small company founded by Peter Lord and David Sproxton in the mid-70s. They're speciality was the almost lost art of stop-motion animation, particularly with claymation figures. They enjoyed some success with the amazing Peter Gabriel music video Sledgehammer, that was an eye-popper in its day. But the company really found its feet when novice animator Nick Park joined the studio. It was Park who would put the company on the map, and introduce two of the most endearing animated characters the world would ever see, Wallace & Gromit. The Wallace & Gromit world is a most peculiar one. Wallace is a scatterbrained inventor, always working on the next madcap invention. Gromit is his faithful dog, and much smarter than Wallace ever will be. With his incredibly expressive monobrow, he watches in silent dismay as Wallace's cock-ups get them into the wackiest adventures. Everyone of the Wallace & Gromit shorts has been a delight. So far we've seen the likes of a skiing oven, robotic trousers, a cyber-dog, a cereal killer, and with they're feature film debut, a Were-Rabbit. The films manage a perfect blend of laugh-aloud comedy and smart visual invention. My mouth always waters at the prospect of the next adventure. And A Grand Day Out is where it all began. Wallace and Gromit are lounging they're Bank Holiday away, but Wallace wants to go somewhere exotic. When there's not a piece of cheese in the house, Wallace on an impulse, decides to build a rocket ship, and fly to the Moon, where everybody knows, is a place paved with cheese. When they get there, they have to contend with a ski-obsessed oven/cooker, who won't leave them in peace. Even in they're debut, Wallace & Gromit and A Grand Day Out is a charming adventure. All of the things we would come to expect about them are plain to see, albeit in a slightly rougher, uncut form. They're characterisations have already been established, with Peter Sallis nailing Wallace's dimwitted inflections. And Aardman's love of nutty contraptions is there too. The film comes with many delightful sight gags packed around every corner. I especially liked the rocket ship's wallpapered interior, and the throwaway sight of a handbrake on the control panel. But the most inspired idea is a coin-operated oven lying neglected on the Moon. I've always been an enormous fan of silent comedy, which is one of the reasons I like Gromit so much as a character. And Park and Aardman create an intriguing character with this oven. Wisely they don't give it a voice of its own (perhaps the budget didn't allow for two voice-over artists?). Instead they just build a character out of incidental details. And its all done in total silence. Like the cooker's daydreams of skiing, giving a parking ticket to Wallace's rocket, gluing the surface of the Moon back together, trying to hit Wallace with a truncheon only for the money to run out mid-swing. Nick Park directs it all with such a light touch that the film breezes by. However, as much as I enjoyed the film, it does have its flaws. A Grand Day Out is probably the weakest of the Wallace & Gromit shorts. The animation is a little rough around the edges, and lacks the pristine sleekness of the subsequent entries. It also falls down in the plot department. All of the other Wallace & Gromit films are driven by far stronger stories. This one is quite thin. For instance, we never learn how the cooker wound up on the Moon in the first place. (You'd almost swear it was something Wallace had dreamt up). The plot, such as it is, is made to take a backseat to the (admittedly funny) visual puns and Wallace & Gromit's effortless double-act. Perhaps A Grand Day Out hasn't aged as well as the other films, but a lot of the things we've come to love about Wallace & Gromit are already in place. One area where it does have the edge is the fact that its the most conceptually ambitious. All of the other films in the series have remained earthbound, and A Grand Day Out is the only one so far to aim for something a little more profound. It touches upon themes that are rarely seen in animation today. If it had the budget accorded to The Curse of the Were-Rabbit then perhaps A Grand Day Out may have become something extraordinary, rather than just an engaging entertainment. To look at it in the harsh light of day, A Grand Day Out is really the prototype. It was The Wrong Trousers that set the style for the series, and struck up the balance between top quality writing, sidesplitting comedy and fabulous animation in all of the right places. Still, a highly promising debut nonetheless, that rightfully converted an entire nation.",1.0
6493,"Kate Hudson movies are lame!; The only thing that I now about that twit Kate Hudson is that 1. she defies the Cat Stevens song, ""Wild World"" by getting by with her incorrigible beaming smile and 2. her plucky personality that got her ""foot in the door"" to be the star of Hollywood, chick flick hell movies with barely any noticeable moments of actual dilemma, confrontation or believable conflict, with everyone coasting on their merry way, and making sure that nobody in the audience is stirred by anything remotely provocative or interesting. Not only that, when you are in so-called comedy, the movie is supposed to deliver laughs or perhaps if it is a subtle comedy, one should have the overall feeling that the movie justifies some sort of punch line. Kate Hudson, that French-loving sycophant moron, is not talented enough to carry any comedy film. And that's why all of her films suck because some insecure, talentless producer along with her sycophant to promote lackluster crap, and think that most of Americans desire to see these movies for style and not for substance. They also assume that everyone is programmed to watching trite, predictable, one trick pony, date-movie crap that Hollywood s*its out every other month.",0.0
1223,"Introducing Wallace and Gromit; By now most people, at least here in Britain, will be familiar with Claymation duo Wallace and Gromit and this is where it all started. Wallace is a Lancastrian man with a taste for cheese and Gromit his dog who actually seems to be the more intelligent of the two. As the story opens they are trying to decide where to go on their holidays; then Wallace realises that they are out of cheeseÂ… so decides to head to the moon as everybody knows it is made of cheese. We soon see that Wallace is also a bit of an inventor as he designs a rocket then builds it with Gromit. They get there and settle down to have a picnicÂ… and find the moon is in fact made of cheese. They also find a coin operated machine which when activated doesn't approve of the damage the visitors are doing to the moonÂ… it also sees a travel magazine they brought and dreams of skiing! This isn't the best of the Wallace and Gromit shorts but it is still a lot of fun and does a great job introducing the now familiar characters. The story is fun in a way that can be enjoyed by everybody from young children to the elderly. There is a great inventiveness about the story; I loved the fact that Wallace is an ordinary person; of course it helps that Peter Sallis does such a fine job providing the voice of the character. Gromit is equally good; managing to be a great character without making a sound; the way he is animated brilliantly shows what he is thinking though. Interestingly there is no real antagonist in this storyÂ… the machine on the moon isn't really malicious even though it provides a mild level of threat. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to Claymation fans; it is a must see for all fans of Wallace and Gromit of course.",1.0

He is hilarious, but there are some tiny moments where he's a bit annoying. But apart from those moments, this is a good comedy. A praised animal has been stolen from an African tribe. It is Ace's job to find it. The only problem is he's afraid of it. The only animal Ace does not like is a bat. But he must put his fear behind him in order to find it. With appearances from Simon Callow and wonderful gags, this is a good sequel. My favourite part was when he wore a man on his shoulders to teach a fox wearing woman a lesson. Worth watching!",0.0

Peter Sallis again does a superlative job, and I must say he sounds more confident than he did in Grand Day Out, while the visuals especially the character designs have more finesse and the music is rousing. I loved the scenes in the museum, and my favourite scene was the train scene, towards the end. The trousers idea was a great idea, and it worked to an advantage. In conclusion, a hilarious short, and my advice to anybody who hasn't yet seen it, is do so now, because you'll never regret it! 10/10 Bethany Cox.",1.0

However the new lodger takes Gromit's room and puts him out in the dog house.  Meanwhile Wallace continues work on a pair of remote controlled trousers.  But is the new lodger as innocent a chicken as he appears?  Wallace finds himself part of a major jewel robbery Â– can Gromit return in time to save him? The second of the adventures of Wallace & Gromit sees the animation greatly improve and the comedy oh so very sharp and funny.  The basic plot is a little silly but very well crafted considering this is a short film Â– I wish many `proper' films had plots this clever and imaginative.  It is also absolutely a wonder to watch Â– even when I wasn't laughing I was easily charmed by the wit and imagination of the whole thing. The animation is superb, Wallace is as good as ever and Gromit is much more fully developed and is easily the star.  The penguin however threatens to steal the show as well as the jewel.  How can a plastercine penguin with a glove on it's head that likes listening to organ music be threatening?  Well it can Â– here he snaps his head round and stares with such menace that it's frightening!  They all work well together but Gromit takes the film by a nose. With all those  brain dead kids cartoons around on TV this should be treasured.  Adults will love it as there is plenty of detail for them to enjoy and kids will totally fall for the rich comedy and well animated characters.  A wonderful little gem.",1.0
19,"A Complete Farce In Nearly Every Sense; Though I consider the first ""Ace Ventura"" film to be perhaps my favorite comedy of all-time, ""When Nature Calls"" is nothing more than a shame to both the legacy of the first film and to Jim Carrey's career. Likely rushed to the theaters (only a year after part one) due to the success of the first movie, ""Ace 2"" never even comes close to capturing the pure hilarity of the first effort, and (on its own merit) isn't even that funny overall. Whereas in the first go-round Carrey was able to do his crazy facial reactions and physical comedy that made him a household name, in this film (because of the very poor quality of jokes/gags) he completely overreacts to every situation. I never thought I would say that Carrey could overreact to anything, but he actually does go WAY too far time after time after time. Though the first 10-20 minutes of ""When Nature Calls"" are moderately funny, from there the movie absolutely tanks. The first time I watched it, I actually fell asleep about 20 minutes in, as the jokes/Carrey were no longer holding my interest whatsoever. Thus, I would not wish this film on anyone. If you want more of Carrey's best performances, stay away from it at all costs, as it will leave you wondering how/why he would even sign off on the script.",0.0

6101,"Gripping; There's a particularly chilling scene in this movie. It comes near the end in a confrontation between Charles Horman (Jack Lemmon) and staff members of the American ambassador in post-coup Chile, 1973. To this point the staff has sounded polished and professional in their concern for Horman's missing son, an apparent casualty of the coup. But in this scene the devious reality of American policy begins to emerge from behind the velvet glove, and Horman's passage from credulous liberal to disillusioned skeptic is complete. In a nutshell, the scene symbolizes one of the great divides in American political life, between the polished propaganda face our government presents to the people and the grim realities that face covers over, especially in dealing with Third World countries like Chile. Horman represents the frustration many feel in trying to deal with a cosmetic facade supported by both major political parties, when beneath it crouches the murderous policies of imperial rule.The real question the film poses is what Horman will do upon returning home. The film itself remains a gripping eyeopener from first to last. Costa-Gravas is especially good at recreating the abject terror of fascist rule: where long hair is forbidden and women are forced back into skirts, where people are present one minute and gone the next, where a democratically elected government is present one minute and gone the next, and where a Henry Kissinger can do the behind-the-scenes dirty work and be honored for it (not in the movie, but true nevertheless). The acting is first-rate, and a tour-de-force for Lemmon in particular. Ditto, the often overlooked Charles Cioffi who puts the real chill in the confrontation scene. Two complaints: the arch symbolism of the riderless white horse conflicts with Costa-Gravas's documentary approach, and why, oh why, did they have to make Horman's son so cuddly. The audience gets the point without spooning on the sugar. Anyhow, this remains a fine piece of revelatory film-making and retains as much relevancy for today's audience as it did twenty years ago.",0.0

It's brilliantly clever, imaginative, funny and arguably the most memorable of the films. The attention to detail and the amount of effort that must have gone into every frame is mind blowing. No special effects or CGI, just plasticine and a hell of a lot of time and effort.

5214,"Heavenly casting, but an un-divine script...; Religious whimsy for the soft-hearted (and headed). Right in the middle of ""Oh, God!"", in which supermarket manager John Denver tries convincing his family and the rest of the world that he's frequently visited by the Almighty himself, the protagonist is given a list of very tough religious questions and is locked in a room to answer them; just as he hopes, God (George Burns) pops in and fills out the questionnaire to help this young man out (and ostensibly prove to people he isn't crazy). This sequence is so cogent and well-acted by Denver and Burns that it surely will be the catalyst to turn the movie's third act around and give us some believers. Sadly, director Carl Reiner and screenwriter Larry Gelbart (working from a witless book by Avery Corman) completely drop the ball, and Denver ends up in a courtroom. What might have been a sentimental but incisive look at religion today is turned into an updating of ""Topper"", with Burns exiting the room like the Invisible Man.

19,"Carrey is such a classic; OK I know this movie is a bit silly to say the least, and pretty gross in parts, but you gotta hand it to Jim Carrey there's few who could do it as good. Ace Ventura is such a knob but Carrey makes you love him. The scene of the rhino 'giving birth' has to be one of the funniest if not most disgusting scenes from any of Jim Carrey's films. And he does it so well! Coming out like a new born calf, naked frightened and slimy. Gross but oddly compelling. There are so many times I find myself rolling on the floor laughing in Ace Ventura, for example at the 'monopoly guy' (""Do not pass go, do not collect $200!) or the projection room scene in the consulate when he just sits down in front of the projector (I don't know why something so simple could be funny I'm laughing at it even now!) and to when he does shadow puppets to the Consular's nipples! Its not high brow, its pretty disgusting and the plot is barely important, but Jim Carrey is funny, his expressions, his energy and the complete randomness (the monster truck for example, or him bumping up and down in the jeep when the road is completely smooth) and I find him likable. If you're not a fan of Jim Carrey and don't enjoy his style of comedy, then what are you even doing looking at this movie! Most people probably hate it, but I still think Jim Carrey is more original and unpredictable than some of the terrible imitations. I'm looking at you Rob Schneider! 'The Animal'?. please.",0.0
6101,"incendiary statement second, moving and exceptional father-son story first; What will make Missing memorable for even longer than the 27 years since its release is not just its political relevancy or even its arguable statement about the nature of deceit in matters of political convenience (i.e. US government lies constantly to protect its own ass, in this case the Chilean coup and the ties to disappearances all over the place), and yet on those points alone it would still be a film to recommend for the ferocity director Costa-Gavras makes with the material. It is, in all actuality, the human element, that first and foremost for Costa-Gavras is that Missing is about a young man who just vanishes one night away from a loving but perpetually cynical and liberal-minded wife and a conservative, Christian-Scientist father who, too, really does love his son with all of his heart. This part of the story, which Costa-Gavras latches on to as the dramatic sail to pivot through the documentary-style investigation of Horman's disappearance, could have been in lessor hands the fodder of a decent but unfortunately forgettable TV movie (I imagine something like this coming on HBO to some polite acclaim as opposed to the divided but very strong positions on this film). But he wants to cut past anything too sentimental- yes, even with Vangelis on score providing some approximately mournful tones on the synthesizer- because these are real people and they had to deal with this very real and tragic and horrible moment in their lives, and so the filmmaker casts with a particular sense of accuracy (Jack Lemmon for vulnerability and an intelligence that pierces through the BS and Sissy Spacek for an acuity with the character that still allows for moments of real sadness). Everything after Horman's vanishing is told from their point of view, never cutting to some third-person scene with an authority figure. It's probably the closest we'll get to knowing the facts in the case, as a young would-be writer and filmmaker, played by John Shea, who has ties to some possibly spied-on targets but is relatively harmless. One night as Sissy Spacek, playing his wife, doesn't get home in time due to the nightly curfew imposed on the streets of the city, Hormon is ""taken away"", by some military force, and he is nowhere to be found or heard from. His father, played by Lemmon, flies down from New York and at first is irritant: when will that boy learn that this way and that away from home is not the way to be? All of this melts away completely as the fact remains: he's missing, may be dead or at best injured, and the American embassy and ambassador make outright lies, really, in the face of not really knowing what happened... or rather having ties with the Chilean military force (some good questions get raised about America's involvement in the Coup), and how other people such as a cocky Italian friend is killed when, originally, said to have returned safely to Chicago by the State department. There's so much rich detail to the picture that it's hard to describe it all here. Suffice to say that along with Lemmon delivering what might be his best dramatic performance and Spacek giving her all whenever it's needed, which is often, the direction is exceptional here. If not quite the towering achievement of Z, it's still about as close as one could want with the material. By focusing on the physical, hazardous nature of this environment, of a perpetual street war zone going on where gun shots pierce a conversation out of nowhere or an earthquake doesn't mean that people can go out into the streets cause of the curfew, it doesn't become stuck in its time. Like Battle of Algiers, Missing provides a stirring sense of what it must be like- hell, basically- to be in a place an time where people are shot, openly, on the streets and terror runs rampant by military might. But there's also that human edge: it's watching great acting and being absorbed in a story one has never heard of before. A shocking one. One of the best films of its year.",0.0

Initially I thought A GRAND DAY OUT was interesting but flawed, while THE WRONG TROUSERS was a piece of perfection that marked the flawless highlight of the series. By contrast, A CLOSE SHAVE feels half-baked and rushed out, keen to emulate rather than innovate. Remember how ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES fell to bits with the introduction of the wives and girlfriends and was much better when it was just Del Boy, Rodney, and Grandad? That's the case here. The addition of the friendly sheep and Wendolene is a step too far and takes the charm away from the original characters. Wallace is a clichÃ© here and Gromit is just bland.

The two find themselves on a road trip across the country to Tucson where she plans to start all over again, but not before various stops along the way keep them from achieving their goal too soon. Diane Ladd is brilliant as Flo, the nasty-mouthed waitress at the diner where Alice gets a job to stay afloat (Polly Holliday made a name for herself playing the role on the hit television show ""Alice"" that was based on this film).

8838,"Surprisingly emotional work from Scorsese.; I don't think my disdain for Martin Scorsese is much of a secret for anyone who knows my taste in film, so it came as a welcome surprise when I found myself being moved and impressed by his 1974 film Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. Telling the story of a recently widowed woman (Ellen Burstyn) who takes her son on the road, this was a touching study of a woman struggling to find herself in a time when many women determined their worth based on the man who was at their side. In a lot of ways it takes an interesting look at the era in which it was made, but even today it stands strong as a look into this woman being stripped bare of the things she thought were important and being forced to find out what really matters to her. She finds a few romantic partners throughout the film and it starts to get an ""all men are evil"" theme going on which I was getting worried about, but Robert Getchell's script ends up coming back around full circle to an ending (that was created by actor Kris Kristofferson, who plays one of her lovers, the day before they shot it) that was touching and spoke to the journey this character was brought down. There's a Wizard of Oz metaphor that bookends her evolution, which I found touching without being poured on too much. Scorsese, known for his gritty approach, was surprisingly adept at bringing this woman's story to the screen. This is a film that could have easily gone down the saccharine, cheesy Lifetime route if it was handled improperly by it's director, but instead Scorsese is able to make it feel shockingly genuine all the way through. There are moments that are incredibly uncomfortable, such as Burstyn making her way around town desperate to find a job to support her and her son, along with ones that are genuinely terrifying, like when Harvey Keitel's character punches through a glass window in order to break into her hotel room in a brutal display of male aggression. There's a shift in this character that occurs over the course of the film, slowly developing from a woman who lets men control her into a woman who isn't afraid to stand up for herself and her son, that is portrayed brilliantly by Burstyn. She won an Oscar for her role and it was incredibly well-deserved, along with the fellow nomination that came to Diane Ladd, who steals all of her scenes as a waitress at a diner where Burstyn's character eventually begins to work at. I think it's the mother/son dynamic that made the film work the most for me though, as I found a lot to personally connect to in it. As an early child of divorce, I spent a lot of time growing up with just my mother and myself, and the relationship between them in this film felt so true in regards to my own experience. The way that the two would drive each other mad one second, but the next they would come back together and be laughing or supporting one another. I felt a deep connection there that touched me a lot. Ellen Burstyn's character here reminded me a lot my own mother, and watching her evolve on this path to finding herself meant quite a bit to me. Solid work by everyone involved here.",0.0

It is far superior and a much more mature film than, say, Thelma & Louise. If you're looking for female ""empowerment"" movies. Alice is reality.

1148,"A great animation that everybody should watch; It is hard to believe that this classic short is almost twenty years old and it is as good now as when I first saw it. Wallace and Gromit first appeared in 'A Grand Day Out' and that was a fine story but this, their second outing, is better! The story opens on Gromit's birthday and he is not impressed with his present; a pair of techno-trousers that will take him for a walk while Wallace is free to stay indoors. As the bills are piling up Wallace decides to take in a paying lodger; this lodger turns out to be a rather sinister penguin who wastes no time taking over Gromit's position in the household. It soon becomes apparent that the penguin is even worse than we suspected; he reprograms the techno-trousers and replaces the control panel with a remote control so he can send Wallace to steal a priceless diamond while he is fast asleep! Untimately it will be up to Gromit to save the day! Nick Park and Aardman animation have become bywords for quality stop go animation and this is largely down to films like this; it packs a full story into thirty minutes and the plasticine figures have more character than many real actors. Of course it helps that they have the wonderful Peter Sallis to provide the voice of Wallace. The story is told in a way that is funny, exciting and even a little bit tense at times! The final chase scene on the model train is a classic which belongs in any list of top chase scenes.

Kris Kristofferson costars as a rancher with whom Alice eventually falls in love. A very young Jodie Foster had an early film role here, one which would probably inspire Scorsese to cast her as Robert DeNiro's leading costar in ""Taxi Driver"" the following year.

Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek, however, give a magnificent performance helping to bring the movie beyond blunt anti-U.S. attitudes.

As the plot is based on true story and if you know the background, you know the course of events and the ending as well. I did not and so everything was thrilling to monitor as there were no indications if/when someone gets hurt or killed, or not. There are plenty of moments where the options are 50:50 - as during military-related situations, soldiers may act as they please without fearing to be punished. Nevertheless, Missing can be considered as a gifted political movie - Costa-Cavras has always been a sign of quality.",0.0

The dialogue in this movie was very over the top considering this movie was made in 1973.

6101,"Lost in limbo; After disposing of the Allende government, Chile's military proceeded to ""disappear"" several thousand inconvenient left-wingers, while the new regime professed to be upholding law and order. For the relatives of those missing, the result was limbo, loss with no possibility of closure, accountability or retribution. This mood of tragic uncertainty is nicely captured by Costa-Gravas's film 'Missing'. And although it may seem to be looking only sideways at the issue by concentrating on an American caught up in the coup, rather than a native Chilean, in fact, this adds another layer to the story, because the U.S. government (in what is a true story) might have been genuinely trying to help American citizens, but undoubtedly also had dirtied its hands in the coup itself. The story of Chile in the 1970s continues to move me every time I hear of it; not because it was the scene of the worst brutality in human history (sadly the thousands of dead are outnumbered in many other places), but because of ruthlessness of what happened; a democratically elected government directly opposed the interests of everyone with a little bit of money or power, and for this foolishness, was exterminated. This film is a worthwhile record of part of that story.",0.0

He gets a spot on the Dinah Shore Show and he's hounded by publicity. A group of religious scholars including the bombastic self-righteous Reverend Willie Williams (Paul Sorvino) gives him a quiz of 50 questions to give to God. It's a bit of light comedy mixed with a serious message. George Burns as God is a stroke of genius. John Denver is good as the nice everyman. It takes some sharp jabs at organized religion and the world in general. Some probably would take offense because this is a particular God and not one of any religion. Burns is as sharp as a knife and the quiz is especially pointed. The courtroom is a bit too broad. In a way, the card trick is a bit too lowly for God but he wraps it up nicely.",0.0
1148,"A Comedy Miracle; Nick Park's concepts for animated shorts may appear deceptively simple:  A man and his dog visit the moon.  A man takes in a boarder, who turns out to be a penguin.  A man and his dog uncover a dastardly sheep rustling ring.  One would expect animation which is cute -- but not nearly so clever as Nick Park's team have been in THE WRONG TROUSERS. Using only their hands and tiny tools to mold and shape the clay from shot to shot, Wallace and Gromit's creators gave them life, personality, style, quirks, and sympathy.  Gromit is eloquent without speech.  Even the Penguin communicates deviousness and evil without facial expression or vocalization.  In THE WRONG TROUSERS, this villainous Penguin is even frightening when he appears to have caught Gromit spying on him. Of course the highlight of this half hour comedy miracle is a chase scene on a model train set which runs on a track through Wallace & Gromit's home.

8838,"Follow Your Dream...Or Not; The movie's first scene shows Alice as a little girl in a parody scene of a musical, where she sings a song out of tune and yet thinks she can make it as a professional. Years later, she is a married housewife with a scary (if not abusive) husband and a badly-behaving 11-year-old boy, and has had a brief singing career. But Alice is devastated when her husband is killed in a truck accident, and she sells her furniture and home and moves to another city with her son, with plans to live in a motel with her son while working with the idea of saving enough money to eventually move back to Monterrey, California, where she had been happy. But things do not go as intended. She meets a man at the place where she has gotten a job as a singer-only to find him a married man, and a violent thug to boot, so she abruptly flees to another city. She cannot find a singing job, so she has to take a waitress job at a diner, which she hates. She is also constantly fighting with her son, who is flippant and disrespectful. She meets another man who definitely has no other wife-but is he a prize? And has Alice been fair to the people around her, who have problems of their own, or has she been too self-centered all along? As the movie reaches the end, she finds herself questioning everything. The man has hit her son, but was that brutality-or did the son, with all his rudeness, genuinely deserve it? Could this man really be a match for her after all? With a child to take care of, is her dream of being a professional singer really important? Then why did she have a husband and son to begin with?

6101,"Makes it easy to disregard politics for an emotional father-son drama; Of its many winning aspects, ""Missing"" is that unusual political thriller in which the affairs of state don't overwhelm its humanist story. All this really is is a father trying to locate his absent son. Sure, the government officials are there to stonewall him (and just be duplicitous bastards in general) but who among us can't identify with Jack Lemmon's desperate search for answers? The movie sets the tone very nicely; shots ringing out, bodies in the streets and Vangelis lays on the ominous synth score. But it's really just Lemmon's painful journey from unquestioning American to abject disillusionment. He's the bewildered heart of this movie.

Gromit, our surrogate 'detective' is taken out of the action, leaving us with the clueless Wallace. All we get is tepid suspense, instead of clever noir construction. The focus is on composition -- Wallace's fumbling romance in the foreground with sight gags going on in the background.

8838,"Not bad; Martin Scorsese is one of those guys who either makes total crap and the actors save him (Raging Bull), or he actually makes a decent film (Goodfellas, a great film). In the case of ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,"" it's not quite a case of it being a bad film saved by the actors, as the film is OK, but the acting definitely elevates this movie for Scorsese. Ellen Burstyn is pretty much just perfect as Alice, who's nasty husband dies (and who is relieved?) so she sets out with her foul-mouthed 12-year old son on a quest for a life, really. She is a singer (and not really a good one, or a good piano player) and she starts singing at some sleazy joint. Here she meets Harvey Keitel, who, let's face it, is always so good you almost don't care what film he is in. Putting on the charm, it turns out he's a married guy, and a lunatic, as he beats up his wife in front of Alice, and threatens to break Alice's jaw. Alice and son promptly leave town, which is a good move, because there's no way she would have escaped a beating from this guy. Then she ends up at Mel's Diner and starts waitressing. This is also where the TV series takes place (with Vic Tayback, the same Mel who is great). Alice meets Kris Kristofferson and her son meets Jodie Foster, a perfect tomboy. Kristofferson always had a low-key style I always liked, and he was often better than his material. It gets really predictable from there, and the ending, particularly the ""big scene"" in the diner, is especially groan-worthy. A scene towards the end of Alice and Flo in the women's bathroom discussing Alice's life literally stops the film cold and drags it through the mud. Overall though, Scorsese does a decent job at showing small town America, and while again, this film isn't necessarily bad, it's the actors that make you want to watch, not the director. And what do you know, was that a T-Rex song (""Jeepster"") playing for a few seconds during a car scene? Someone had very good taste!",0.0
1148,"'It's the wrong trousers Gromit, and they've gone all wrong!'; This is my first experience with the clay animated Wallace and Gromit series, and for sure it's not going to be my last, as this must be the hardest I laughed at a movie for years! Wallace and Gromits quiet lifes come to an end when Wallace, who seriously needs the money, rents Gromits room to a penguin. Gromit immediately thinks something's going on when this penguin leaves his light and music on all night, but sneaks out of the house himself. Wallace however finds the little penguin a great treat, as he brings him the newspaper and his slippers. Gromit thinks he's of no use anymore and leaves the house, right after his birthday on which he got a pair of mechanical trousers, which are playing a large role in this 30 minute comedy. You see, anyone with the remote can do with the trousers what they want, and the evil penguin is making a use of that. So one day he lets Wallace slip into these trousers, makes him tired so he will fall asleep in the trousers. That way he can rob a diamond from a museum, and he succeeds. But Gromit was onto the little guy and when both come back to the house he's waiting for them to stop the penguin. A hilarious chase on little trains is the result. So much for the story, let's start with the praise. The animation is fantastic. The story is entertaining, compelling and even has some scary moments. The side gags are endless(ly funny). My favorite: while shadowing the penguin Gromit is watching him behind his newspaper. In the newspaper there's a story about: 'Dog reading paper'. I love that. And what about the scene when Gromit slips from the bed into the chair, and there isn't any toast ready. You know what's coming next, and Gromit as well... it's just fantastic! But the end scene on the trains is the best part IMO. I don't know if anything can ever match that... it must've been the funniest thing I ever witnessed. I would have written more, but I can't wait to watch 'Cracking Contraptions' next, so I'll just leave you with this: if you don't see in the fun in this, you're a lost cause. 10/10!!!",1.0

It turns out that the penguin is actually the infamous thief Feathers McGraw and Gromit has to stop him and rescue Wallace. I like the comedy of Wallace and Gromit. I love the addition of the criminal penguin. He is funny, cute and villainous all at the same type. It's such a great character and should be their nemesis as much as possible.

5214,"Gentle, but significant; This is a warm, inclusive film. Maybe there's a bit of nostalgia in my comments, but I appreciate this movie's approach to faith. God comes in a form that our modern society seems to enjoy dismissing-- the elderly. It's a delight to George Burns, who really does have all that mileage on him, and John Denver, whom no one will mistake for Laurence Olivier, create this relationship between the mundane and the spiritual that is relatable, relaxed and relevant. In our culture, we already know about the forbidding and the punishing, and the hostility between faiths. But here's a God who says, paraphrasing here, ""Jesus was my son. Moses was my son. Mohammed was my son. Buddah was my son. And so are you. And so is the guy who's charging you 18.50 for a piece of room service roast beef."" Inclusive, with gentle humor. Burns' performance suggests a being who has seen a lot of the world, and doesn't expect anything of importance to happen quickly. It's a loving and practical relationship between the everyday and the sacred. And the old hands, Barnard Hughes and Paul Sorvino, and the whole gang of great character actors, make this a treat to watch. And gee, having Teri Garr play exasperated. That's like asking Pavarotti if maybe he'd like to sing something. Maybe a bit sweet for your taste, I don't know. For me, I can actually watch it whenever it comes on and enjoy every moment of it.

6101,"An essential film to see in today's world; In a world where our biggest fear has become random, stealthy terrorism, it is easy to forget that for much of the twentieth century our fear has not been nearly enough directed at states, governments- sometimes our own. From Stalin, Mussolini and Hitler through to fascism's pervasion of the 3rd world in monsters such as Pinochet, we have always had the most to fear from merciless, gigantic totalitarian regimes, far too many of which have been backed by the United States. What ""Missing"" cannot say, though it says a lot, is that the country it portrays is Chile in the first days of the unelected reign of Pinochet. What it does say, much of which has been corroborated by recently unclassified documents, is that the United States, led by the statesmanship of Henry Kissinger, supported Pinochet's coup and toppling of a DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED REGIME because they were not friendly enough to ""American interests."" The bottom line, as the movie makes inarguably clear, is that a South American Hitler was propped up into power largely thanks to the United States; the blood of thousands of Chileans is thus partially on our hands.  This is the larger political point of the film.  Until our government owns up to this, one of the most abominable and least-discussed crimes of the Nixon administration, the film ""Missing,"" despite being a fictional take on true events, will be an enormously important document. This is art so close to politics that there's almost no art there.  But it still must be seen; the message is too important.  All Americans need to confront this episode in our past and come to terms with the fact that our government is a democracy only up to a point.  Beyond that point, there are decisions made that we have no control over, no knowledge of, but nonetheless result in horrific events. Costas-Gravas sketches a Santiago beyond all nightmares, so hellish that it simply had to be true.  With almost constant gunfire and monstrosities going on in plain view, we watch Americans suffer enormously under the strain and stress.  The film is an exercise in impotence, de-humanization.  Jack Lemmon, in one of his most courageous performances, has the humility to offer an utterly normal American man's reaction to all this.  First he trusts his government, and then, as he realizes that they are at fault for his son's death, he simply implodes.  He makes threats but we are instantly told they will achieve nothing.  He is even reprimanded by the American officials responsible, his son should have not been a ""snoop"": ""you play with fire, you get burned."" He crumples, worn down by a world more brutal than imaginable.  It is the price we pay, the film seems to say, for living in a safe, wealthy country like America: this blood on our hands that we don't ever think about.  And then, if we are forced to confront it, our own ignorance leaves us too weak to deal with it. Lemmon's character's impotence is matched by that of his son's, in his arrest and death.  This is one of the bleakest films I have ever seen on the subject of individuality in the face of the state.  Chile is here meant to stand both for the 3rd world and America- both at once, complicit in this mini-Holocaust.  His son is a decent guy, totally harmless, attempting to ""be connected to the whole enchilada,"" as his wife puts it, but certainly no revolutionary.  But what does this life, this human being who has lived with integrity, matter when bulldozed by the sweep of a machine-like government? Indeed, the US officials who pretend to help Lemmon are truly cogs; emotionless, deadpan, their portrayal is surely propagandistic- the politicos of our worst fears.  But the film's resonance is more the possibility that this was true; it seems likely, given what is now known of Nixon's administration.  What other sort of people could have knowingly perpetrated such monstrosities besides Eichmanns, empty of soul or conscience, pure puppets? As I said, there is ultimately little art in this film.  It is certainly not about the triumph of the human spirit, as the battle is already lost before Lemmon gets to Chile.  No, it is more about the total negation of the human spirit, and body, for that matter, in the face of the indomitable state. Problematic as it may be, this art document leaves a strictly political aftertaste, because it so convincingly asks the question: why, as a country, have we not come to terms with the fact that our government is responsible for events like this, time and time again?

8838,"Martin doesn't direct here anymore...; Yes, Martin Scorsese can make a film about real people. Yes, he can make a film with strong female characters. Yes, he can make a film rich in humor, romance and human warmth. Now, why won't he do it more often? ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE is an anomaly in Scorsese's filmography. He is a director for hire here, brought on at the request of star Ellen Burstyn. He agreed to give the project a try because he needed a commercial hit, a studio project. And he pulled it off: Alice is one the few Scorsese films that was embraced by both the critics and the audience. The director proved that he can make films about human beings, not just human monsters. Though made in the sloppy, ragtag style of the 70's, the film has great energy and even greater heart. It is probably the only Scorsese film that allows the audience to identify with the characters on an equal level. We don't look down on these characters, they don't oppress us with cruelty. The people in ALICE are people that anyone who has ever eaten in a diner can relate to. But, even though he does a fine job of directing, I don't think Scorsese really understands or cares for the people in Alice's world. He seems uncontrollably draw to self-destructive characters who are possessed by violence. Perhaps that is how he sees himself. That's a pity, because, like his Travis Bickles and his Jake LaMottas, Scorsese seems intent on using his talents to reinforce the darker parts of his nature, rather than to bravely explore the more benevolent side of life and his own psyche. He allowed himself this one opportunity to delve into human reality, did it well, then never came back. ALICE may not be Scorsese's most personal film or even the most well made, but it is his one film that tries to connect with the human spirit. This is a film to enjoy for its content, not superficial style. Scorsese stumbles once in the story. Along the way Alice encounters a would-be beau played by Harvey Keitel, who, in standard Scorsese style, proves to be an abusive creep. Keitel's little cameo has a shocking dishonesty to it, needlessly injecting violence and bad overacting into a story that otherwise unfolds with natural charm and grace. The quicker Scorsese gets this unnecessary little homage to himself out of the way, the sooner ALICE continues on with its bittersweet journey. Oddly, ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE was embraced by the feminists. They even concocted an ""Alice Doesn't"" day, in which women were supposed to boycott work to show how important they are to the workforce. This suggests that the feminists of the era weren't in touch with the women of America. For one thing, the real Alices of the world couldn't afford to miss a day's pay just to participate in a flaky protest demonstration.  But more than that, Burstyn's Alice is not a rebel. She takes on the world out of necessity, not anger: unexpectedly widowed, with a teenaged son, little money and only a vague notion of how to face the future, Alice meets life with a pragmatic determination. Somewhere between the glowing optimism and the crying jags, she is an unwilling fighter and her cause is not feminism, but simple survival. She is not what feminism is all about, but she is what feminism should be all about. Perhaps that is what Scorsese brings to the table in ALICE. Under Scorsese's direction, Alice isn't a victim. So many female movie characters of the era were meant to be symbols or messages, or they were nonentities because the filmmakers were uncertain of the politically correct way of presenting women. Thus female characters were avoided or delivered with heavy-handed political baggage in tow. Scorsese to his credit has never played that game. He lets Alice be strong, but flawed; a character defined by both her strengths and her insecurities. She's not there to be a symbol or to deliver a message, only to be. She is unique to motion pictures, only because she is not unique to women of the real world.",0.0

8838,"Joyful, Enjoyable and Beautiful; One of Martin Scorsese's early movies, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore is very good. It's shot in a raw, gritty, realistic way, and that's the best part of the movie. But there are a lot of other things to enjoy in this hidden gem: the performances, the music, the inspiring storyline and believable characters, the editing and the message and exquisiteness of this. The beginning is perfect. You see a young girl singing, next to her house, and everything's so dreamy. Then, you're introduced to Alice's life in a really well done way. As the story develops, the characters become more consistent and you can't avoid to like them. The dialogs are always realistic and meaningful. The direction, as I said, is amazing. The hand held camera makes it realistic and gritty, and the dusty look of this movie makes this even better. The other great part of the direction is the feminist message. It works so well, without being forced, and at the same time it can show several beautiful relationships. The shooting is really well done, adapting to the scenes. It makes them often funny beautiful, touching or violent. The actors are all very good. Even if sometimes I felt Ellen Burstyn was a bit hysterical, that's a part of the character. All her emotions come out in a great way. This is a brilliant leading performance. Her character isn't slim, particularly pretty or anything; she's just a normal woman trying to work her life out. Kris Kristofferson gives his character wiseness and beautiful feelings, at the same time he underacts in a good way. Alfred Luter was very natural and funny as Alice's young son. I think everyone knows kids like him. Harvey Keitel was very frightening in his part, but a bit clichÃ©d. I don't think this is his fault, though. Billy Green Bush is OK in his small part and Jodie Foster is very funny and charismatic in her small role. Diane Ladd is very funny and great to watch. With all the great scenes, the beautiful photography, stunning direction, great acting and touching message, this is undoubtedly worth watching.",0.0
8838,"Alice Moved on to Mayhem: Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore ***; With the sudden death of her husband, Alice-Ellen Burstyn in an Oscar winning performance, is forced to fend for herself and her son who is quite a character. The story deals with the odyssey of Alice and her son as they attempt to get to California. It's a story of a desperate woman, slapped down by life itself who really tries to pull herself up against adversity. She meets up with Ben, a young stud who is cheating on his wife. Harvey Keitel,as Ben, shows a mean, vicious streak and is compelling in his brief turn on screen. Kris Kristofferson is basically a man of her dreams. It looks like the affair is over when he attempts to discipline her unruly son. While trying to sing, Alice winds up as a waitress in Mel's Diner. There she meets Flo, played with relish by a gutsy Diane Ladd. Ladd is a foul-mouthed babe one moment and an understanding friend the next. She well merited her best supporting actress nomination here. Vera, in this film, is depicted as an out of control, emotionally unbalanced woman. She is totally different from the Vera of the television series. That person was vulnerable by her simplicity. Burstyn earned the Oscar as a woman driven by despair, desperately hoping to grab something positive in this life. Vic Tayback is the only cast member who was also on the television series. He is much more subdued here.",0.0

But in the end, just like this movie, people are too smart to be fooled by the propaganda. We can all recognize there are SOME Americans in positions of power that are not honest and straightforward.

6101,"Shooting people is wrong - even for governments; During the Cold War (1945-1990) it was the policy of successive US governments to maintain authoritarian right Â–wing governments in power all around the world if there was a possibility that they might be replaced by one from the left, democratic or otherwise. As the US ambassador in this film reminds us  `we act in the interests of the United States', not in the interests of the country which happens to be suffering under a fascist dictatorship. We can accept this on an intellectual level Â– how else can the US government establishment act -  but in this movie Costa-Gavras uses his very considerable skills as a film-maker to rouse even diehard conservatives to anger over the methods used to ensure Pax Americana. He does this by dramatising the real-life story of one of their number, Ed Holman (Jack Lemmon), a businessman from New York and a crusty Christian Scientist with  faith in Truth, into the aftermath of a military coup in an un-named South American country the capital of which is called Santiago. (I think we can safely assume the country is Chile, though the locations appear to be Mexican.) His son Charles (John Shea), a vaguely left-wing journalist and writer, living in the city with his wife Beth (Sissy Spacek), has disappeared after being arrested a few days after the coup and carted off to a makeshift concentration camp in the National Stadium. Initially, Ed believes the people at the American consulate and embassy really are there to help him, but it soon turns out they have an agenda of their own. Ed and his son's wife start out on bad terms but Ed comes to appreciate her bravery in the face of a very unstable situation. He also comes to realise the moral worth of his son, who he had previously regarded as a bit of a playboy, much as he had loved him,. An almost surreal feature of the movie is that  people behave almost normally despite the obvious signs of murder and mayhem going on in the background. In fact the only time the `comfortable classes' are disturbed is when there is an earthquake affecting Ed's Santiago hotel. Otherwise, the guests are happy to watch from the upstairs terrace the military killing people in the streets. Of course General Pinochet still has considerable support in Chile, and in August 2000 your reviewer witnessed a large demonstration outside the Supreme Court in Santiago against a decision lifting the Life Senator's immunity from prosecution. It was a very well-dressed crowd. Ed's odyssey through hospitals, morgues, police stations and the National Stadium is intercut with flashbacks which make it plain enough what has happened. Yet in classic thriller fashion we are kept on the edge of our seats with what will happen next. Politics aside, this film succeeds as a thriller involving believable people rather than stereotypes. Jack Lemmon gives the dramatic performance of a lifetime as Ed, the fuddy-duddy who really does care and leaves no stone unturned to find the truth. Nearly 30 years later, Chile has a democratic government, Pinochet is too infirm to stand trial, Nixon is dead and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is an elder statesman on the celebrity circuit. The only communist regime in Latin America, Castro's Cuba, is still there. This film reminds us that immoral policy, whether or not it achieves its objectives, remains immoral. The fact that US foreign policy is regarded as being in the interests of the United States does not make it more moral, even if you happen to be a citizen of that country, where as Ed reminds us at the end, remains one in which you can at least sue for justice. Sadly, Ed did not succeed.",0.0
6101,"Excellent, gripping movie -; Not an in-depth review, but with a different spin in regard to the facts concerning the Allende government... ""Missing"" is the gripping and powerful story of Charles Horman, a somewhat naive and idealistic American writer-journalist's disappearance in the short aftermath of the coup-d'etat in Chile, and the subsequent search by his wife (Spacek) and his father (Lemmon) to find him. As the story unfolds and the two principles' search follows the many leads, the viewer is torn between conflicting stories, raising hopes that he is still alive and will be found, and the pure hell felt by that the worst possible scenario - death - may be the only outcome. Instead of taking a macro perspective of the events that lead to the coup and why it took place, Gavras makes this a journey through the personal perspectives of Charles Horman's wife and Charles' father, and the changing dynamics of their own relationship, a relationship from the beginning built on tension and misunderstanding, to one of understanding and bonding as the facts concerning what truly happened to Charlie are revealed... not to mention Charlie's father's personal revelation of his son's true goodness and purity. So sad that he comes to this understanding too late, after it is discovered that the worst possible scenario has come to pass! Excellent performances all-around - Lemmon (one of his best), Spacek, and John Shea as Charles Horman. Also, it can't be denied Gavras' ability to capture the horror of a nation under siege and the affects on both citizenry and soldier. Examples that always stick with me: the surreal scene of a horse galloping down the street as it is being chased and shot at by soldiers; the faces of terror on people who are stranded on the streets after curfew; the patients of a mental hospital running to view the bodies of the victims floating down the river. I believe that Gavras, regardless of his political leanings, told the story of the Hormans in the only way it could be told. As I said before, he takes the micro-perspective of this tragic era in Chilean history by taking the viewer by the road of the Hormans in their search for Charles. What was not discussed was the reason for the coup and omitted for the most part. Please understand that I do not endorse the measures taken by the Chilean military in the least, nor am I blind to the US's explicit and shameful support for such action. Nevertheless, Allende's actions in running a fairly functional country into the ground is never mentioned. It would take too long to analyze here, but in only a very short time, a man who was elected by a minority of the vote - in no way did he have a mandate of the people - dismantled a country's economic infrastructure, implementing a radical socialist one in its place (and we're not talking a European socialist model). This result lead only to making the poor even poorer, not to mention destroying the economic livelihood of the middle- and upper-classes. Still, if I were to tell this story, I can't see a way of enlightening the audience to this fact, nor do I see it being relevant to the story of the Hormans. This is a personal story, an unimaginable and outrageous tragedy... and a wake-up call, especially for Americans who believe the American government in its foreign policy is even slightly altruistic, or concerned first and foremost about the safety and welfare of its citizens abroad, especially when there are overriding interests concerned. This is a must see! Kudos to Gavras - definitely his best!",0.0
5214,"""Lose a job, save a world. Not a bad deal.""; God comes to Earth in the form of George Burns and tells supermarket manager John Denver to spread His message. Charming low-key comedy with a very likable cast. Denver's appealing as the 'everyman' protagonist. Burns, of course, steals the show as the affable Almighty. The rest of the cast includes the lovely Teri Garr as Denver's wife, Paul Sorvino as a televangelist, vets Ralph Bellamy and Donald Pleasence, and many other recognizable faces. Great cast all around. I also enjoy the low-budget look of the film. It's a very 1970s movie (in a good way).

6101,"Powerful, moving, and an indictment on those who support those who abuse power; One scene in Missing that sticks out is at the beginning when during curfew late at night, a military convoy drive past a high class party (possibly at the US Embassy I guess) who applaud the convoy, whilst the party is playing Chuck Berry's classic hit ""My ding-a- ling"" at full volume (number 11 I guess). This symbolizes so much - the alliance between the military dictators and their wealthy supporters. In real life under the Chilean coup (upon which Missing is based just in case you're wondering) I wonder how the Embassy folk partied throughout the night. Did they have sleeping bags in the embassy compound? I do wonder. Another scene is where a US Embassy official, with the flash of his diplomatic passport, earns a firm salute from the security man, to get into the airport I think. Again, we sort of learn who's pulling the strings here. But unfortunately being American did not save Charles Horman (John Shea) and Frank Teruggi (Joe Regalbuto who later gained much sitcom fame in Murphy Brown) from being executed by the military.",0.0

Instead of the claymation, soft plastic figures that are poseable are used instead. Additionally, the sets are much more complex and detailed. Now this isn't to say that the stuff in the earlier films is bad--far from it. It's just that with each successive project, the artistry improves. The only complaint I have about this delightful film, and it's a minor one, is that by this third short, the story has become a lot more fanciful and action-packed. In this film, less time is spent being laid-back and gentle (as well as very English) and Gromit even gets to fight against a cyborg dog! But, in spite of this, the film still works very well. Additionally, if you watch this film and the later full-length movie, WALLACE & GROMIT AND THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT, you'll see that there are some similarities in the stories. The dog is pretty similar as is his owner to the lady in the full-length film. Again, these really aren't complaints as much as observations. Overall, a wonderful short film and one you can't help but love. It's wonderful and I can certainly understand why it, too, won an Oscar for Best Animated Short (like its predecessor).",1.0
6101,"Well worth seeing regardless of your politics.; The film begins in Chile at the time of the coup that ended the Allende government. When Pinochet and the rightists came to power, huge numbers of folks simply disappeared or were executed outright. Anyone who could have posed a problem to the new government simply were eliminated--by the thousands. One of these was Charles Horman--an American journalist who was just too outspoken to be ignored by the regime. Although you see him as the film begins, soon he disappears and his wife and probable widow (Sissy Spacek) is beside herself trying to find him. Soon, Horman's conservative father (Jack Lemmon) arrives and has faith that the US embassy personnel with help him in the search. Eventually, however, it becomes obvious that the personnel are NOT there to help and probably are complicit in the disappearance. What are they to do? They're in a hostile land with few, if any, allies. This film won an Oscar for Best Screenplay. It was also nominated for Best Actor (Jack Lemmon), Best Actress (Sissy Spacek) and Best Picture. I am surprised that ""Gandhi"" won the Best Picture award that year--especially since the film was, in many ways, quite inaccurate historically (I am a history teacher--trust me on this one). ""Missing"" was a better film--as were ""The Verdict"", ""Tootsie"" and ""ET"" (in my semi-humble opinion). I wonder if perhaps the film's politics doomed it to lose--though considering Hollywood generally DOES run left, this may not be the case. I am a reasonably conservative American, though I feel ashamed when I see films like ""Missing"" (as well as Costa-Garvas' other famous film, ""Z""). While I am glad that the US had been traditionally anti-communist, this single-minded approach to international communism appears VERY misguided in hindsight. In too many cases, in order to combat this, the US government sponsored repressive and evil regimes--when they should have been pushing for self-determination and freedom. No matter how you try to excuse this, situations like the ones in ""Missing"" are simply inexcusable and the film should be seen by everyone--not just those on the left politically. Why? Because, the story in this case is TRUE--the situation involving the Pinochet regime in Chile was just plain evil--and should NOT be forgotten or ignored. History should be understood and lessons learned from them...or they'll be repeated. Well worth seeing and very well made overall.",0.0

5214,"'A lesser human being'; There's a great line from Inherit The Wind where in examining Fredric March on the stand Spencer Tracy deflates March who is on that prosecution team as a celebrity religious authority.

Oh God examines the proposition that God might speak to a lesser human being in this case Assistant Supermarket manager John Denver. You can't get more average and ordinary than Denver a decent soul raising a decent family in this crazy world with not any formal religious affiliation. Which is maybe the reason God who appears to Denver in many places and guises as George Burns. Burns with that disarming manner makes one droll Divine Deity. Larry Gelbart who wrote the script which brought an Oscar nomination to Oh God filled it with some sly and very profound observations on the human condition. Free will folks is the key, he gave us the world and humankind made it what it is today. The film is well cast. I truly enjoyed Paul Sorvino's pompous pompadoured reverend.

5214,"Simple and warm.; Something tells me this film would work a lot better if it was shot today; and by that I don't mean a remake, but if somehow we could transport the cast and crew (Reiner, Burns, Denver, et al) to 2004, let them shoot the film, and release it, it would be the super sleeper smash hit of the decade.  A remake would fall flat on its face. The story is quasi-original.  The notion of a higher or supreme being asking one of us mortals to do his bidding is nothing new, but to place the gentle and warm spin on it, and to take that legend out of its biblical era context, and place it in (what was then) contemporary times, is really a stroke of genius. Burns plays a grandfatherly God who is concerned, though not wrathful.  This God is not Cecil B. DeMille's fire-and-brimstone God from ""The Ten Commandments.""  Nor is Burns' God the detached entity that is less hands on than God's foes in ""The Exorcist"" or ""Omen"" series.  In ""Oh God"" we have a creator who wants to instill a little reassurement to Earthbound souls.  Burns' character is one with a need that must be fulfilled.  But Burns' God doesn't go about it by creating apocalyptic scenarios to threaten nor coax mankind into the task.  Instead this God approaches the problem with a more thoughtful plan.  Veteran Vaudevillian George Burns' does a superb job portraying the Almighty, and does so with sublime humor and grandfatherly frankness. Denver portrays an honest grocery store manager whose sole purpose is to satisfy his customers.  That is until George Burns beckons him hither.  What's even more amazing is the fact that, to the best of my knowledge anyway, Denver gives us an exceptionally convincing performance but with little professional experience.  The Jerry Landers character he portrays is honest, thoughtful, earnest and full of conviction.  Denver lets his own character shine in this performance. The real genius of this film is that the comedy is very sedate while still being funny.  The film doesn't try to be something more than what it already is.  A film with God as a character could've gone anywhere, but Reiner doesn't take too many liberties with the material at hand.  Instead he keeps film focused and even keeled, while tossing in good humorous bits to keep up the levity.  Even so, please be warned, the laughs are spaced out.  This is not a film filled with wall to wall gags.  Both humor and overall energy are kept low to drive home the storie's message. This is in comparison to a recent ""reincarnation"" of the God theme/film in ""Bruce Almighty,"" which has often been compared to Reiner's 1977 work by commentators on this website.  I finally saw ""Bruce Almighty"" recently, and where I found sections of it humorous it really didn't hold a candle to ""Oh God.""  The theme was selfish, the character was selfish, the overall feel was typical 90's corporate art, with Jim Carry's absurdities thrown in for poor measure.  This is largely because ""Bruce Almighty"" is really a different film, with a different premise, and regrettably (though not unexpectedly) botches most of the affair.  ""Bruce Almighty"" satisfies a juvenile curiosity.  ""Oh God"" is a soothing uplift, and, by contrast, is the better film. ""Oh God"" doesn't have any direct and explicit sexual references, there're no body function jokes, nor obvious and readable plot points nor plot holes, unlike a good number of today's films.  There's no rap ""song"" at the end credits, nor cameo by some pop artist (other than Denver, who plays the lead), nor any product placement.  Nor is there even any CGI (though it may've benefited from one or two CGI shots).  ""Oh God"" a basic film with a timeless premise, and very simply message. See ""Oh God.""

8838,"Flo, Vera and Mel; When I was younger, my sister and I would spend countless hours each day watching television. One of the programs we found ourselves glued to was Alice. For those who may not remember the show too clearly, one phrase may help jog your memory... ""Kiss my grits!"" If that didn't help, you probably have never seen the show (or as some folks may say... ""it was before my time."") Anyway... last night I saw a film titled Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. Upon starting the movie, all I knew about it was that it was directed by the great Martin Scorsese, and that it was about a widowed wife and her son who drive across the country. To my great surprise, the character Alice is the same character from the TV sitcom. I didn't put two and two together until halfway through the film when it showed the diner with Mel and the other two waitresses. It was fun to see the other characters like Flo, Vera and Mel (the movie's Mel was the same actor as the TV show's Mel). Many of the elements were similar between television and movie; the only noticeable difference was the tone. On television, the show was a sitcom comedy made to get a good laugh every few minutes. The film, however, was a bit more serious because of various real life situations (relationships, child upbringing, death). This coincidence made things much more interesting as the film continued. Don't get me wrong, the movie was pretty damn good already; I just seemed to enjoy it a bit more when I started putting the pieces together. Scorsese, once again, showed his incredible directing skills. He was able to bring the viewer into the extreme pain and desperation of the main character, while at the same time, show the positive things in Alice's life through his use of color and cinematography. Overall, the film was enjoyable because it was quite heart warming (in contrast to the more famous gangster type films by Scorsese).

8838,"Can I stroke your beard? (ew); I'll admit, American movie making reached a feverish creative peak during the 1970's. With films such as Taxi Driver, Dirty Harry and of course, The Godfather, Hollywood was certainly on a creative roll. I am really not too certain whether 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore' belongs there though. The story, of course, focuses around Alice, a financially struggling mother who decides to move away to Fresno for a new life with her kid. They take a pit stop in Arizona though, because she runs out of cash and her car breaks down. When she is forced to take a waitress job to make ends meet, she soon finds out that life and love is where you make it, even if that means shacking up with Kris Kristofferson. I guess the big problem I had with this movie is that it really doesn't seem to go anywhere. Oh sure, Alice goes to all sorts of places, but the story hardly moves at all. And to be honest, I didn't think Ellen Burstyn's performance wasn't all the revolutionary. Oh sure she's all right, dynamite in some places. But Academy Award worthy? Nah. Even worse is the kid who plays her son, who immediately gets on your nerves and stays that way thoguhout the movie, whether he's meaning to or not. Funny when Jodie Foster comes on the screen (looking a lot like Macaulay Culkin by the way) , she just acts CIRCLES around the guy. But actually, my favorite performance in the movie has to be from Harvey Keitel as the lonely salesman who has too many skeletons in the closet lol.

8838,"Scorsese's Overlooked Masterpiece; *SPOILER ALERT* This small and oft-overlooked offering from Martin Scorsese (his 4th feature) ranks among his best and most interesting for a number of reasons Â– it's one of the only Scorsese films with a woman as the protagonist, and Â– in typical Scorsese fashion she's tough, if a bit conflicted (like most of his male protagonists) Â– and real, in other words. ALICE...also provides a another great glimpse of his very original style as it was developing Â– the continuum between MEAN STREETS, this film, and TAXI DRIVER in look, mood and performance is perfect, as the post new-wave grit and furious energy of MEAN STREETS is a bit more focused here. Overall, ALICE... is a more subdued character study which Â– like life - swings from gripping to scary to funny to touching in the blink of an eye. Also notable as one of Scorsese's handful of non-New York stories (like LAST TEMPTATION, CASINO and KUNDUN), ALICE... follows Alice Hyatt (Ellen Burstyn, fresh out of THE EXORCIST and at her peak) Â– a California native, living in New Mexico with her truck driver husband. Suddenly widowed, Alice decides that she and Joey are going to take off, on what little cash they have left, for California, so she can pursue her long-dormant dream of becoming a singer. They make it as far as Arizona before Alice runs out of cash and has to stop to find work. After initially landing in Phoenix Â– Alice ends up living in a rent-by-the-week motel in Tuscon, working at Mel's, a trashy diner run by its' amusingly belligerent namesake Mel (Vic Tayback), and staffed by the wild-but-wise Flo (Diane Ladd, in another amazing performance) and psychologically unstable Vera (Valerie Curtin). Before long Alice begins to put down roots, and she takes up with David (Kris Kristofferson), a local rancher. The lone potential flaw is the ending, which feels like a compromise - if after discovering her confidence and independence, Alice feels like she oughta ride off into the sunset of Monterrey, she also wants companionship, and has allowed this desire to lead her into questionable choices in men (witness one of Harvey Keitel's most unforgettable performances) because of it. So, if a somewhat conflicted ideology lingers through a film where tough mindedness and harsh reality (interrupted by the occasional bit of lifelike, randomlike humor) gives way to romance, then perhaps it simply is indicative of how cerebral ideologies sometimes will Â– or should Â– crumble in the face of human emotions and desires. In any case this thoughtful tension at the heart of this beautifully acted, beautifully filmed tour-de-force gives ALICE... a rich, earthy energy that places it among the most thoughtful and multifaceted films (like TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL and also the underrated KUNDUN) that Scorsese has ever made.",0.0
8838,"Scorsese's small-town American cinema.; Looking at Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, it has that certain feel of unique nostalgia. Like The Graduate or Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice, this film certainly had to have struck audiences in a new and unfashionable way when it was released in 1974, yet today it doesn't feel as new or special simply because we have seen and understood its message and take it as fact. The film follows Alice, a small-town wife of a Coca-Cola truck driver living as a housewife in New Mexico but with dreams of stardom and glamour, something she had when she was younger living in Monterrey, CA. After her husband's death, she decides to reclaim this dream and moves her life and her 12 year-old son Tommy to California. Along the way, they make a few stops for cash as Alice looks for employment as a singer. In Phoenix, she is only able to be hired as a waitress in a tiny, hometown diner where she meets many colorful, unique characters befitting for a story such as this. The main theme of this film is the progressive view of women in American society, certainly a theme that was perceived in 1974 as bold and fresh as women has usually been treated as objects, both sexually and socially. The character of Alice, remarkably and fully convincingly played by Ellen Burstyn, is much more complex then initially seen: bold, brave and willing to stand up for her beliefs in her own ability, yet has multiple scenes where she lets her emotions overtake her and we realize how much she has relied on others, most notably men, to care for her and how she tries to correlate this with her feminist ideals. The opening sequence is a direct reference to The Wizard of Oz as it paints a portrait of a young girl's fantasies about life for her as an adult. Of course, Scorsese and Burstyn are using this to contrast with the reality of Alice as a housewife and dependent on men. However, when she meets a man who approaches her through her son and appeals to her intelligence and femininity, she is unwilling to immediately corroborate his feelings, have been hurt too many times earlier. The film certainly understands the importance of its message, as do I, but the way in which it is visualized puzzles me many times. In particular, I was most perplexed by the character of Audrey, a young (girl?) who Tommy meets and introduces him to a world of underage drinking and shoplifting. The character is played by Jodie Foster, who I swear looks and acts exactly like a young boy, a fact most construed when she is wearing a dress. This is a very unimportant plot line, but I was confused as to why Scorsese decided to make the gender of this character so cryptic. To look at this film in the whole context of Scorsese's filmography, this film has a unique place. It was more of Ellen Burstyn's project than Scorsese's and this shows. Still, Scorsese is able to use some of his special fluid camera movements and wide angle shots, which are most useful and wonderful to look at. Still, knowing what we know now, this is definitely not the Scorsese we admire today. There are traces and seeds of future projects here, but ultimately this doesn't move or inspire so much as perplex and bewilder. Clearly, Scorsese was still developing.",0.0
6101,"Excellent; MISSING is an excellent movie telling the story of American businessman Ed Horman and his struggle to recover his son, who vanished during a coup in Chile in the 1970s. Jack Lemmon is Horman and he's brilliant...he's mannered yes, but his ""acting"" is perfect for this role...you feel his frustration with both the US and the Chilean governments. He encounters endless bureaucracy in his search. He's helped a lot by daughter-in-law Beth, played by Sissy Spacek in a performance of remarkable restraint. The great supporting cast includes Janice Rule, Melanie Mayron and David Clennon as a less than helpful government man. John Shea plays the missing son and he's terrific. MISSING is sad, scary and heartbreaking...directed, with his usual gravitas, by Costa-Gavras",0.0
1148,best Aardman film ever; I think this is the greatest Aardman film ever.I have not yet seen a single Aardman film that I liked more than this.The plot was great.Gromit has to stop the evil penguin from stealing a diamond that belongs to a museum.At the end there is a 2 minute train chase at the end.I thought it was too short 2 minutes a lot of ending battles would be longer than that but it still had plenty of detail in it.Youhave to watch this and all the Wallace and Gromit films. you are going to love them all. After all a lot of other Aardman films are also really good. really they are after all the penguin is a great villain and I really like him I have never ever seen a clay animated penguin before until i watched this great and wonderful film,1.0
745,"Wallace and Gromit tackle sheep rustlers!; This; the third outing from the now famous 'Wallace and Gromit', sees our unlikely heroes tackling a pair of equally unlikely sheep rustlers. There have been a spate of sheep thefts which have led to a wool shortage; then one night a sheep escapes from the rustlers van and gets into Wallace's house. The next day Wallace gets a call from the local wool shop; they need his window-cleaning services. Once there he is immediately smitten by Wendelene; the shop's owner. It isn't until he gets home that they discover the sheep; which has by now cause quite a bit of damage. After a slight accident while cleaning the sheep Wallace decide to dub it Shaun. It isn't long before they have another run in with the rustlers; this leaves Gromit framed for the crime while Wallace is oblivious to the involvement of Wendelene and her brutish dog Preston. If Gromit is to be saved and the real criminal punished Wallace will have to help Shaun and the other sheep break Gromit out of gaol then confront the evil Preston who isn't quite what he initially appears. To my mind 'The Wrong Trousers' is the best 'Wallace and Gromit' story but this is almost as good; it has all the elements we've come to expect. The chemistry between Wallace and his dog; the silent, but clearly more intelligent, Gromit is perfect making them one of the great comic double actsÂ… the fact that they are animated makes it easier to accept the otherwise ridiculous situations. A live action film featuring a dog in a motorcycle sidecar which converts into an aeroplane with a porridge firing cannon would be ridiculous but here it is a work of genius. The variety of Wallace's inventions is impressive as is the way they frequently don't work quite as he planned. Wallace's doomed romance added another emotional side to the story without being too 'mushy' for young viewers. There are of course lots of good laughs to be had although I'll endeavour not to spoil them here! Overall I'd say this is the sort of programme that can be enjoyed by people of all ages even though it is obviously aimed at the younger viewer.",1.0
1148,"It doesn't get better than this; Wallace and Gromit first came to my attention about ten years ago when I saw the film ""A Grand Day Out"" on TV. An excellent short which I gave a 9/10. ""The Wrong Trousers"" is even better. Wallace is an English inventor with a love for cheese, crackers and his cup of tea. Gromit is his dog, and the star of the shorts. He doesn't talk at all, but he doesn't have to, all is said through facial expressions and body language, and done perfectly so. Gromit is the work of a comedy genius. In this short Wallace is short of money, so he puts up a room in his house for rent. Soon after a penguin, yes a penguin, turns up at his door. Like Gromit, he doesn't talk at all. The penguin takes great interest in Wallaces new invention, a pair of remote controlled metallic trousers. I won't tell anymore, you'll have to see for yourself, but all the thirty minutes we are served very clever comedic details, you'll find more and more the each time you see it, generally a lot of craziness and especially ""the train-scene"" which will make you laugh your head of. A must see. 10/10",1.0
1148,"Who couldn't love Wallace & Gromit?!; This is the second Wallace & Gromit film and unlike the last one, which was only nominated for the Best Animated Short Oscar, this one was this prestigious award. While it is pretty much more of the same type entertainment from the first, it is a bit more polished and fun--plus it's still Wallace & Gromit and who couldn't like this?! Wallace, ever the tinkerer, builds Gromit a strange robotic device. It looks like the lower half of a person (hence 'trousers') and was designed to take Grmoit ""walkies"" whenever he wanted. Around this same time, a strange penguin comes to board with them. Little did they suspect that the penguin is evil and will ultimately use Gromit's new trousers for evil! The film, like all Wallace & Gromit films has a lovely and gentle sense of humor and a certain likability that captivates people who watch it. Top animation, voice acting and direction make this a big winner.",1.0
1223,"The birth of a legend; Say cheese. 13 years after Will Vinton invented it, claymation is back. This short film was a milestone in animation history. The fact that Park lost the Best Animated Feature Oscar to himself that year does it no harm. He won with his three follow-up Wallace and Gromit films then, the last being a full feature. I quite like this short film, not as much as The Wrong Trousers, but more than A Close Shave. Park is on such a creative high that year that he brings us Wallace & Gromit, almost in their ultimate shape, with a great catchy tune and also already a prospect of things to come in the famous Aardman sheep on the picture at the wall of the rocket. What do you do when you realize that you've run out of cheese for your crackers. That's right. Go get some and combine with your annual holiday travel by picking the moon as the destination. After all, it's made all of cheese. Gromit's look to the camera says it all. But how did they get the cows up there? Anyway, watching this short film I had to think of French movie pioneer Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s' Trip to the Moon which shows quite a few parallels: the planning, the rocket building and finally the flight from the inhabitants. This can't be a coincidence. After they reach the moon and we get to see a short gravity joke, they run into a cleaning robot, who's quickly fed up with tidying up after the mess Wallace leaves behind after testing different moon cheese culinary meals from several corners of the moon. He is rewarded in the end for his efforts and his dream finally comes true. A must-see for animation lovers.",1.0

Wallaces face is not perfected and not the best of the shorts but I still recommend it. Why? Well it's still Wallace and gromit and your still going to get some funny jokes and a happy ending plus the 2nd best version of the Wallace and gromit theme at the end credits, I really enjoy it. My Favourite parts is the end and building the rocket. Peters voice is great with some great claymation and starting a great score I recommend it!",1.0

The only -- and I stress, ONLY -- drawback is that it should be labeled ""Warning: Choking Hazard! Do not consume food or beverages during this film.

5214,"A sweet movie; ""Jerry Landers"" (John Denver) is a family man with a steady job at a grocery store. One day, he gets a weird letter telling him to go to a building for a meeting with ""God"" (George Burns in one of his most famous roles). ""God"" asks him to get His message out to the world. ""Landers"", who is skeptical of the kindly old man who asks for his help, and a non-believer in God, tries to get out the message by any means. He eventually gets on national television, and in front of a panel of religious leaders, who ask him to have ""God"" answer a list of questions, written in an ancient and extinct language. Now, ""Landers"" has to prove to the court of the existence of ""God"", while trying to defend himself in a slander suit filed against him by a televangelist over comments ""Landers"" credits to ""God"", who claims the televangelist is a fraud. Let me say that, when I first saw this, I thought it was funnier. Having seen it all these years later, the jokes fell flat in my opinion. However, I was not once offended by any joke in the film. The humor targets a lot of questions believers and non-believers of the Almighty ask when questioning their beliefs, but not once is offensive. If you ask me now, the jokes are worth a couple of chuckles. For anybody who is a hardcore believer, who will walk up to a stranger to give his or her testimony and try to convert the person, I can guarantee you that you will not be offended with this movie at all. The subject matter is handled with extreme care, and is handled perfectly by Denver, and especially Burns. The performances in this movie are pretty good if you ask me. Terri Garr, who portrays Denver's wife, plays her character as a woman who is skeptical of her husband's believe that he was visited by God, but supports him no matter what. Denver was pretty good in his role, never missing a beat as Burns straight man, and handled his character's transformation in the film nicely. Burns though is easily the star of this film, and made ""God"" one of his most memorable roles in his career. Anybody who has seen this movie, or its two sequels have never forgotten Burns in this role. To his fans, this and his role with the love of his life, Gracie Allen, is fondly remembered. This film is perfect for families, as their is no violence or swearing. Younger children may not understand the message of the film, but might enjoy some of the jokes. Older kids will understand the message, and may have questions about their own faith. The supporting cast is not well developed in this film, especially the televangelist, who was the most vocal in the counsel that asked ""Landers"" to have ""God"" answer the questions they gave him. Personally, I would have liked to have seen the televangelist go to his flock and the media to try to discredit ""Landers"" in his believe he saw ""God"". Just having ""God"" tell ""Landers"" to call the guy a fraud to help set up the court scene was a bit weak in my opinion. There is some special effects in this film, but you can tell they were all done by editing. They just don't hold up after all these years. The soundtrack was completely forgettable as well. In my opinion, this movie is not bad. I would suggest to watch it on television if there is nothing else on.",0.0

1223,"No cheese left? Why not go to the moon?; This short film was the start of an amazing career for claymation artist Nick Park, in a film involving an inventor and his clever canine. This was the first of the four wallace and gromit movies that he made, which included a rocket, a bizarre robot and of course Wallace's favorite's food... cheese! The plot involves Wallace in search for some cheese. There is none left in the pantry and searching through his magazine of ""cheese holidays"" and sees an amazing opportunity. This film uses the old ""is-moon-really-made-of-cheese?"" theory in a cunning way. Wallace, and his clever hound Gromit, construct a big rocket to take them to the moon. Wallace has the time of his life sampling many different cheeses, but an old robot is stirring up problems for them and causing mayhem... if you want to see these problems, get the movie! Fun for the whole family.

MISSING boasts several outstanding performances, chief among them Jack Lemmon's: has any actor, in any movie, ever managed to convey such pathos? I'm hard put to think of one- and Sissy Spacek's low-key deference to Lemmon's anxiety is the perfect accompaniment. Thomas Hauser (whose biography of Muhammad Ali was one of my childhood treasures) tackles slaughterhouse politics with a keen eye toward the Truth; he pulls no punches- one can't ask for more than that. Now that the Truth is finally beginning to be disseminated around the world (thanks to DEMOCRACY NOW!, FREE SPEECH TV, ALJAZEERA and LINK TV, among others), there's hope that euphemisms like ""lobbying"" (bribery) and ""campaign donations"" (graft) that are used to allow racketeers of every stripe to shape political policy and to prop up or take down- or to prop up and THEN take down- corrupt regimes around the world will finally be dispensed with and things set right.

The plot is as good as all his films but the animation looks old and a little thin Â– the budget is clearly smaller for this first outing.  However it still manages to be clever and very funny. Wallace is well voiced and is suitably set out character and Gromit is ever present to raise an eyebrow here and there when his master appears to be foolish.  He isn't as well used as he is in later films but he is still the silent star of this. Overall this may disappoint those who only know W&G from their Oscar winning antics but it is still worth a look.

5214,"""Oh,God!"" is still relevant. (Even if the fashions aren't); One of the benefits of posting from a library,is that some of the movies I talk about are right downstairs from the PC room. This movie is one of them and I had not seen it in over a decade at the very least. I grew up seeing this movie on TV and have always liked everything about it. First thing would of course be it's overall message. That our world can work if we (the nations of the world and individuals who occupy them)learn to work together for the common cause. Not just the cause of world peace but of just simply getting along together and to stop taking the world we live in for granted. In the film George Burns,as God,sees the world he created being smothered by a brown cloud of pollution,his rivers & oceans being poisoned by either chemical dumping or by humans mis-using them as a toilet or trash can. He also talks about how people go around saying he never existed in the first place. (Note: Believing in God has to come from undeniable,unyielding feeling of faith by an individual,which is part of ""free will"".) That said,the second thing is the story of how God chooses Jerry (John Denver) as his modern day Moses by sending him an invitation in the mail. Casting him as the recipient of this task was a great move because John looks like someone you'd see on the street (if he hadn't been famous). Jerry's home and work and entire life are turned upside down by his declaration that he has seen and talked directly to God. Even people in religious organizations think he's a lunatic. Terri Garr is very effective as his loving but distressed wife who just wants her husband to stop it all and be the way he was. The sight gags are good in making us believe this really is God Jerry is speaking too. The 27th floor on a ten story building,God on the car radio & the rain in Jerry's (seen to be believed) Pacer and God's appearance,in coming to Jerry's aid,in the courtroom near the end of the movie. Pretty simple special effects but God most likely (as Burns said) doesn't need flash. This film doesn't either,it may be filmed in simple form but that's the idea here. The message is a simple but important one and you don't need a million dollar budget to send it out. Now here in 2007,kind of sad to say,this is still the exact same message we still need to hear. Basically,if anything,to remind ourselves how human we are and how easily it all could be gone. It may be set in 1977 and the Pacer car and fashions outdated but the story & message are timeless. I just hope one day,the message wont necessarily be needed. Ten stars for all of it(including the great extra of commentaries by Terri Garr,Lary Gelbart & Carl Reiner. (END)",0.0

8838,"Another Satisfying Martin Scorsese Film!; Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore is an entertaining, well-respected film created by the legendary Martin Scorsese. Marty opened the eyes of movie-lovers all over the world with his 1973 film, 'Mean Streets."" He further opened eyes a year later with this film. Despite the film be entertaining to watch, it also shows the director has better days ahead of him. Through all of cinema history, an issue in Hollywood has always been women and their lack of representation. I think it was a necessary, but bold move for Marty to tackle a film that shows life through a woman's eyes. On the whole, the film smoothly changes between drama and comedy. There are some intense dramatic moments, but there are some laugh-out-loud moments. Especially when it came to the interactions between mother and son. Martin Scorsese's film is about a woman named Alice, who is a housewife. After her abusive husband dies in an accident, Alice embarks on a road trip with her only son to find a better life for themselves. But that is easier said than done. Alice learns many things about life as well that finding love may still exist. The film features many fine performances, with Ellen Burstyn in particular. She does a mighty fine job as Alice, the woman seeking a new life. Her interactions with her son are rather nutty and quite genius. Speaking of which, Alfred Lutter does a good job as her son. He can be annoying sometimes, rather admittedly. Kris Kristofferson does a good job in one of his first roles as a romantic interest of Alice. Finally, I liked Diane Ladd's performance as the waitress co-worker of Alice who gets through lifer with quite an attitude. Overall, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore is a really good dramedy about searching for meaning in life. It may not be Martin Scorsese's best feature, but he is learning fast. The story and the performances are top-notch, given the very low budget. But sometimes the tone of the film and how it can quickly change takes me out of the film every here and then. But it's a well-written film that delivers consistent performances and now we all know what to expect from a Scorsese film. My Grade: B+",0.0

6101,"Eye-opening and depressing; Though I was 30 yrs old when the film came out in 1982 I didn't see it at the time although I was aware of its content. And, as is true of a lot of people my age (tho not all, of course), I toyed with liberal political beliefs when I was younger (1960's and 1970's), then gradually became more moderate bordering on conservative as I got older, onto where now I personally am not too sure where to stand. Well, I just saw 'Missing' for the 1st time. It brings back all my previous leftist 'paranoia' about capitalism and national interests. And causes me to wonder why I ever abandoned them. After the movie, I cruised certain sites on the Internet, one being a series of articles referenced in the misc. section under this movie on IMDb. They chillingly re-enforced the truth (?) that at the highest levels of our government there was complicity, even outright orders, to kill thousands, including American citizens, in the interest of capitalism, national interests and (so-called) 'national security'. I am sorry to say (sorry in the sense that with my limited personal intelligence, I am never completely sure if I am right and sorry to doubt my own government) that I am starting agree with some others, that our foreign policy has, is and probably will be be based, to the detriment of our national security, on the almighty dollar. I'm also sorry for the political comments on a movie site but, of course, the nature of ""Missing"" brought this on, and its very well directed, written and acted scenes. Please don't question things I have said unless you have seen the movie and read some of the articles. 10/10 ***new addition*** And I completely, of course, agree with lev_lafayette. Read the book, it is much better. I have read the book, 'Missing'. And as with most movies based on books, especially 'non-fiction' books, the content in the book is more detailed and hits you closer to the bone, heart, mind and conscience in many ways than the movie. And that is hard to believe in this case because Constantin Costa-Gavras (director) managed to create a movie experience that is nearly as moving as the work it was based upon. It was/is a great movie experience....sir. Thank you, CC-G. For those of you out there who have an easy criticism (one I agree with) now of the US (MY country and I care about it) because of Iraq, you need to watch this film or read the book. What can go wrong is deep seated (human instincts) and hard to root out. It can happen to you and your country and government. We are all human and capable of desire, greed and religious beliefs overruling true morality and an open mind and heart. Please, all of you, keep things in perspective.

745,"Each one better than the last; Nick Park's work keeps getting better. You can see the improvements in technique with each film, and the writing gets stronger too. In ""A Close Shave"" he's confident enough to take digs at other films (notably ""Terminator"" here), and it's a credit to the writing and his comfortable, familiar characters that this film carries it off superbly. Peter Sallis as Wallace's voice, Gromit's exasperation and poker-faced exploits, and the innumerable visual puns make this a real treasure. I just wish he would keep making W&G films.",1.0
5214,"A nice, funny, underrated little movie.; ""Oh, God!"" is similar in many ways to ""Bruce Almighty,"" but for some reason the former has gotten little attention over the years while the latter was a hit. While ""Bruce Almighty"" has some funny moments, I think this one is far superior. First of all, George Burns is amazing. Morgan Freeman's God in ""Bruce Almighty"" had a slightly ominous, don't-cross-me nature, but Burns' is a God you can completely trust. He is caring and optimistic, and wants the world to get better. He doesn't throw Jerry into a situation he can't handle; he is there for him the whole time. Plus he is just a really fun guy to be around. Who wouldn't want to believe in a God like that? John Denver also does a great job. It is hard to believe he had no acting experience before this, because he is top-notch. He is a kind, honest guy, not a selfish jerk like Jim Carrey's Bruce Almighty. He is nervous about delivering God's message to the world, but perfectly willing to do it. Unlike that other God movie, this one delivers a good message without getting annoyingly preachy, it is consistently funny from start to finish, it has a likable main character, and it features a God who is a friend, not an opponent. I think everyone could enjoy watching this, whether they are religious or not. Oh, and on a completely irrelevant note, I think Carl Reiner's cameo (doing an impression of the portrait of Dorian Grey) is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. That scene alone is reason enough to watch this movie. 8/10 stars.",0.0
6101,"Interesting drama in a semi-realistic situation; ""Missing"", is the suspenseful drama written and directed by Costa-Gavras that revolves around the Horman family and a military coup in some Spanish speaking country in South America which is never named. Charlie and Beth Horman (played by John Shea and Sissy Spacek, respectively) are a liberal minded married couple who find themselves as outsiders caught up in this coup while living in the country. While knowing the imminent dangers around them, Charlie is never worried and is often the only joyous person around partly due to an almost childish attitude of his. However, one night after Beth is forced to sleep in an alley after being left outside after curfew, she comes home to the realization that her house has been ransacked and her husband is gone. A week or so later all searching for him has proved fruitless and the US Embassy appears clueless as to how to find him. This scenario brings in Charlie's father, Ed Horman, who is almost the exact opposite of his son. He is a very conservative, very predictable man who has never been able to understand his son's spontaneity and anti-establishment views. Ed is similarly disrespectful of his son's wife, Beth, who he believes shares many of the same undesirable traits as his son. Ed, brilliantly acted by Jack Lemmon, travels down to this undisclosed nation to aid in the search for his son. Though initially portrayed as an almost cold-hearted and stubborn father, Ed begins to see Charlie and Beth in a different light after spending time with Beth in mutual despair to find their loved one. Ed's heart 'softens' throughout the film and the change is evident in his attitude towards not only his daughter-in-law but also towards the unhelpful people looking for Charlie. ""Missing"" is an adequate portrayal of what occurs in a majority of oppressive military governments, particularly in South America. The title of the film is symbolic by itself because it shows the despair and hope that families had at the time. Although they were almost sure their loved ones were dead they could always keep hope by labeling them as 'missing' unless proven otherwise. Although a little slow and uninteresting in the beginning this film keeps most viewers involved and attentive throughout the plot line, providing interesting twists and turns and always allowing the viewer to predict the fate of Charlie, Ed, and Beth Horman.",0.0

It's good for reasons why the wrong trousers is good. Great villain, excellent laughs, even better score and some of the best Wallace phrases. Wallace has been through some love interests and this is the best in my opinion. This is in my opinion the best of gromit with some great mystery and funny sheep with I guess was so popular that they got their own show. My favourite scene is where Wallace is reading the newspapers. I also love the climax It's the saddest with gromit in jail and Wallace's expressions and especially gromit's. It's a great film with some good old Wallace and gromit humour aka sheep falling on Wallace I truly recommend it!",1.0
8838,"No Place Like Home; This was a lighter film than I am used to seeing from director Martin Scorsese, known for his movies with gangsters and other blighters. Of course, there are some such characters in this movie--mostly malevolent men. At first, Scorsese showcases some of his directorial ingenuity; the film opens with an old-fashioned credits screen, with Mack Gordon and Harry Warren's ""You'll Never Know"" playing in the background. The opening scene was in homage to ""The Wizard of Oz"". (The fences also reminded me of ""Gone with the Wind"".) But then, Alice, as a child (played by Mia Bendixsen), says ""if anybody doesn't like it, they can blow it out their ass."" ""All the Way from Memphis,"" by Ian Hunter, carries us to Alice, 27 years older (played by Ellen Burstyn in her Oscar-winning performance). Foul language and wisecracks are the brighter part of Alice's life; the other part is hopping from one abusive relationship to the next, while searching for employment. Alice eventually becomes a waitress at a diner (the scenario was revived in the lousy sitcom ""Alice"" (1976-1985)). Diane Ladd earned an Oscar nomination for her performance as smart aleck waitress Flo. Jodie Foster does well as an assertive child. Ellen Burstyn and Alfred Lutter, who plays Alice's kid, carry the movie most of the way, though. When done right, teaming an adult and a child together for the majority of conversation in a film results in an enjoyable, light movie (which this one is). This was Scorsese's first commercial success; with editing and a moving camera among other tricks, his presence is revealed throughout.",0.0
8838,"Who would have thought that Martin Scorsese could do a woman's film?; Widowed mother Alice Hyatt (Ellen Burstyn) sets off on the road to find a living for her and her son, 11 year old Tommy (Alfred Lutter). She ends up in Tucson AZ and gets a job as a waitress in a diner. There she meets David (Kris Kristofferson) and falls in love with him. But is he what she wants or needs? An excellent comedy drama about a woman trying to find herself and what to do after her husband dies. Burstyn (in an Oscar winning performance) is just perfect in the role. You see her struggling and wondering what she wants. Also Lutter is her son and he's not ignored. You also see him struggling to fit in and fall in with the wrong person--Audrey (played by a VERY young Jodie Foster). The script is fantastic full of sharp observations on love, life and sex. There are also plenty of genuinely funny one-liners to lighten the mood. All the acting is great too. I never thought Kristofferson was much of an actor but I like him here. Also Diane Ladd is great (and also Oscar nominated) as Flo--another waitress. There's also a ridiculously youthful-looking Harvey Kietel in a small role. This is a great film. It does end rather conventionally (it seems Alice and David will end up together) but that's a small complaint. This led to the long-running sitcom ""Alice"" which was MUCH different in tone. Only Vic Tayback recreated his role for the series and later Ladd came back as Flo also. It's still hard to believe that Martin Scorsese did this. Recommended.",0.0
5214,"Unpolished cucs!; To whom should Got turn if he wants someone to spread the news? In my opinion he did not make a bad choice back in 1977, when this movie was made: The supermarket manager he contacts is a friendly guy of unobtrusive honesty. He even refuses to have the cucumbers polished as for him this means cheating the customers! (Maybe you got it by now: in the real world I am NOT a highly prized marketing executive!) Am I wrong to suppose that in our days of highly polished cucs such a guy would have been fired instantly for refusing to obey his company's orders? I am slightly too young to judge, but I have the impression that Oh, God! documents the USA's mood of the immediate pre Ronald Reagan era to perfection. Even the Pacer car in which God makes it rain is dead right in this aspect. And listen to the musical score! All in all that era seems to have been a world filled with sunshine and with people who listen to each other when they argue. Perhaps this film is mainly to be watched for historical reasons. For all its comedic style and low key appearance it must be said that the script is superb and that the message still stands. I like to believe in a non sectarian God who is not a gas!",0.0

In Wallace and Gromit's adventure there is a sheep rustler, Wallace falls in love and Wallace and Gormit are ensare in a malevolent mystery only they can unravel. I saw a close shave years ago but I still really like it all these years later, I think most people that see the Wallace and gromit like them and like them still years later.

745,"As technically impressive as the rest, but a bit too over-whelming to be the best; STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits The resurgence in popularity of the plasticine two-some has caused me to also seek out this 1995 entry into the series, the last short film and the only other one I've seen (I don't think I got round to A Grand Day Out.) This time, dodderingly traditional Yorkshire-man Wallace and his faithful manservant Gromit have come up with a spot of bother in the shape of a mysterious pest that's leaving holes in everything in the house, especially the cheese! Wallace won't be having this and vows to investigate! But, first things first, him and Gromit have to run their new window-cleaning service, and their latest customer is Wendolene, who runs a wool shop left to her by her departed father. But, aside from providing a tricky love interest for Wallace, she also has a brutish looking pet dog. And, after a series of local sheep are killed for their fur, the finger of suspicion points somewhere. Technically, this is as fine as TWT and it's very funny in parts, but the plot here just feels a bit disjointed and over-whelming compared to the smoother flow of the plot to TWT. But it's still a far-cry from bad, as such impressive model craftsmanship would be, with Park's twisted blur between the laws of man and animal as high as ever, as Gromit is dealt with not by the RSPCA after being wrongfully convicted of sheep-murder, but the police and jail! ****",1.0

Before classic short films such as ""Loves Me, Loves Me Not"", ""Pib And Pog"" and of course the other Wallace And Gromit short films and before such great films such as ""Chicken Run"", ""Wallace And Gromit"" and ""Pirates: An Adventure With Scientists!"" We have this wonderful short film created by Nick Park in 1989. The animation isn't as advanced as the animation used in other Aardman's short films, but it certainly brings the characters to life. The music is nostalgic, the plot is understandable for children to follow, the characters are likable and above all, its nostalgic charm makes teens and adults like it just as much as children would. The humor is just right and no childish toilet humor or mature strong language is present. All in all, it is a classic! Overall Rating: 10/10!",1.0
1223,"The Dynamic Duo's First; Nick Park's Oscar-nominated first Wallace and Grommit outing is a strange and basic affair, but displaying all of the typical comic touches associated with his production. The lads run out of cheese at the weekend. So, acting upon an impulse and the myth that the moon is made of it; a rocket is hastily cobbled together and they're off into space. The moonscape is very imaginatively created. Strange lunar stalagmites of incomprehensible cheese sprout upwards conveniently for slicing. Time for a picnic. The world seems to be deserted except for a curious contraption that could only have come from Nick Park's mind. It's a cross between a domestic appliance, parking meter, and security guard. Wallace pops a coin in. It's very delayed-action, so he wanders off and leaves it. This gadget eventually switches on and assumes a strange sentience of its own. What follows is an odd-ball chase across the moon with Wallace coming within an ace of getting clobbered. This was the plasticine pair's first big-screen outing and the economies are obvious. The boys have a very coarse, unfinished appearance, unlike their smooth and slick representation in later works. If anything, they are more endearing and less stylised in this first production. Their characters are not yet fully formed. All's well that ends well. The boys blast-off home cheesated, whilst the bizarre lunar-guard learns to ski. Oddly, it seems no longer to be coin-operated. Strange and hilarious, well worth a watch. Presumably they don't live near Tesco.",1.0
5214,Disliked this film; This is a warning to everyone. This comment is going to be a negative review of this film. This film is one of the most blasphemous films that has ever been produced. The first thing that is wrong with this film is the statement that Jesus is not the only Son of God. Jesus is the only Son of God. Jesus is the only way of salvation. Another thing that is wrong with this film is that God is portrayed as a cigar smoker. Another thing that is wrong with this film is the premise that the Almighty is going to let everybody in Heaven. That premise is false. Not everybody will go to Heaven. Another thing that is wrong with this film is that the Almighty could be seen by someone. That is a false concept.,0.0
745,Good family show; A sheep escapes the rustlers into the home of Wallace and Gromit and starts destroying their home without being noticed. Then the boys get a job to wash windows in a wool store. Wallace falls immediately for the owner Wendolene. Her inventor father left the store and his evil dog Preston to her. There is a wool shortage and the rustlers are being blamed. The guys return to find the little sheep and tries to wash it in the Knit-o-Matic. It goes wrong and the sheep is given a Close Shave. Preston steals the Knit-o-Matic design and then later frames Gromit for the sheep stealing. Gromit is put in jail while Preston continues with his evil plans. Wallace and Gromit are great as usual. The addition of the love story is limited in fun. The guys are once again thrown into a crazy adventure. It's not quite as good as 'The Wrong Trousers' but it's still a generally good show for the whole family. I just need more Feathers McGraw.,1.0
5214,"A Wonderful Movie; This movie is so enjoyable and a wonderful story line. I never get tired of watching this movie. John Denver (Jerry) is great as God's medium.George Burns is wonderful as God. This is one the best movies out of the seventies. Teri Garr's performance landed her a wife role in Close Encounters. One of the nice things in the movie is seeing a pacer (which Ralph Nader worked so hard to ban). There was a great deal of editing to make the movie enjoyable. For John Denver (Jerry), his acting role is so good. I don't know or haven't researched any acting he had done prior to this lead. But Jerry epitomized the purity of what God would actually look for in a medium. As for George Burns (God), he had this wonderful ability as an actor: to be serious and get to the point. We have seen this in Going in Style. This movie is great and the only criticism I have is the fact of Jerry being canned at the end of the movie. That would not happen now..At least I don't think so.",0.0
1223,"You've forgotten the crackers, Gromit! (spoilers); Wallace and Gromit claymation shorts are always based on inventive ideas and that's where most of the appeal comes from. Look at 'The Wrong Trousers,' for example, where Wallace and Gromit are held hostage by a fugitive sheep. Here, Wallace and Gromit are on holiday, so they travel to the moon, because they were all out of cheese. And, as you know, the moon is made of cheese. So, the pair build a spaceship and prepare for travel. When they get there, they're entertained by a strange, lonely little robot man, whom they share a space adventure with. Like all Wallace and Gromit shorts, Wallace is usually preoccupied and oblivious to the trouble at hand (he's searching for some delicious cheese here), while Gromit has to protect him and save the day (Wallace usually notices when it's too late). If you have seen any of the other Wallace and Gromit shorts and enjoyed them, you're sure to enjoy this creative little adventure as well. It's always a hilarious trip.",1.0
5214,"""Trust me. Like it says on the money.""; I believe this is the only time where I've read the reviews of those who 'Hated It' (as defined by IMDb voters who give it a lower score than it's average) and they didn't actually hate it. Most have some warm or inspiring words about the picture so I think the movie succeeded on that level. Realizing that many people growing up are fed a doctrine of God being all powerful and vengeful over one's transgressions, it's comforting to see a picture where the Supreme Being is portrayed as just an ordinary human. The series of books by Neale Donald Walsch - ""Conversations With God"" - takes a similar approach and I find this humanistic attitude to be rather appealing. Who wants a God that will strike you down every time you do the slightest thing wrong? At eighty one years old, I think George Burns had the God gig down pat. Very cordial and conversational, he was able to make his spiritual pitch in a manner that wasn't threatening and was even quite inspirational and uplifting. The ideas he expressed were so steeped in common sense that virtually no one could find fault, no matter what denomination one follows. It was best summed up by God himself - ""I gave you a world and everything in it. It's all up to you"". Certainly there are those who question how or why a loving God would allow suffering and pain in the world, and God's answer touched on the one important point most people overlook - the entire concept of free will. Without it, decision making is taken away from humans, and therefore choices are impossible. I was glad the movie illustrated this point brilliantly with the conversation between God and Jerry Landers (John Denver). With a great message, I think this is a wonderful film for the whole family to enjoy. It puts spiritual snake oil salesmen like Reverend Willie Williams (Paul Sorvino) in their place, and invites the viewer to reconsider one's own relationship with the Almighty. To provide another quote from George Burns' God - ""Religion is easy. I'm talking about faith"".",0.0
1223,"Wallace & Gromit: A Grand Day Out; This was the very first of the ever popular special short films starring Plastercine stars Wallace the bald-headed inventor and Gromit the dog. Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) and Gromit are looking at holiday magazines when they decide to have their favourite cheese and crackers. Unfortunately, no cheese, but then Wallace gets the idea to go on Bank Holiday somewhere that has cheese. They decide that this location will be the moon, since its made of cheese (or at least in this animation). They build a rocket, land on the planet and keep trying the cheese made moon. A robot on the planet is trying to stop them while they are on the moon. The quality of this animation is obviously the fact that everything moving is made of Plastercine! It was nominated the Oscar for Best Short Animated Film (it was beaten by Park's Creature Comforts), and it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Film. Wallace and Gromit were number 11 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, and they were number 15 on The 100 Greatest Kid's TV Shows, and as part of Aardman Animations, they was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!",1.0
1223,"""It's like no cheese I've ever tasted...""; There is a lot of be admired about the Wallace and Gromit short films. The intricate craftsmanship is always excellent, and you can only imagine how long it must have taken to film even a second of the stop-motion animation. The humour is gentle and family-friendly, and also very BritishÂ… if that can serve as an adequate description. In this, the first film out of three directed by Nick Park Â– not including the Oscar-winning feature length film of 2005 Â– 'A Grand Day Out' is a genuinely entertaining 23 minutes of imagination and creativity, completed over six years by Park, who produced the film as part of his graduation project from the National Film and Television School. I have heard some remark that the animation in this film is poor, and yet I find myself wondering how they came to this conclusion. Of course, the work may not be as refined as the later additions to the series, given that Park was less experienced and was undoubtedly working on a smaller budget, but the quality is still never anything less than excellent. The story begins on a rather dull banking holiday, and the good-natured Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) is unsuccessfully trying to decide where he and his canine companion Gromit are to spend their day off. Suddenly, Wallace makes a horrifying discovery: their house is completely devoid of dairy products! And so Â– as anybody might do in such a situation Â– the pair endeavour to travel to the Moon, which everybody knows is comprised of cheese. Wallace, being an enthusiastic inventor, casually tosses together a space rocket, and pretty soon they are ready for their big journey. In probably the film's most memorable sequence, Wallace realises, just as the launch countdown is beginning, that they forgot to bring the crackers. Imagine going to the Moon without crackers! However, some quick-thinking and agility from Wallace eventually saves the day, and the pair pass their otherwise uneventful Moon-ward journey by reading the newspaper and building delicate playing card pyramids. Their picnic on the lunar surface offers a hint of imaginative absurdity, with the main storyline concerning a coin-operated gas oven who lives on the Moon, writes out parking tickets and dreams of skiing. All this makes for a quirky, clever and humorous short film that literally anybody can enjoy. Interestingly, 'A Grand Day Out with Wallace and Gromit' was nominated for Best Animated Short at the 1991 Academy Awards, but failed to take the statue. I don't imagine, however, that Nick Park would have despaired; he lost out to a film called 'Creature Comforts'... directed by Nick Park!",1.0
745,"Who let the sheep out?; Right after watching and loving The Wrong Trousers, I decided to give Park's follow-up a re-watch. I have to say as much as he succeeded with mixing crime and western elements into his last work, he comes short here when it comes to romance and mystery. While the occasional laugh can't be denied to any W&G picture, including this one, the whole sheep rustling mystery plot left me completely unimpressed. While the Wallace-Wendolene love story seems charming at first, mostly due to how she mirrors him so much down to her ""dog"" reading the paper Gromit-style, it quickly becomes unnecessary and boring (almost cringe-worthy during the ""leave-me-alone""-sequence) to the extent that one feels nothing during the final action scene and also their final encounter at Wallace's door. Completely unrelated, even Gromit was surprisingly uninteresting here, to the extent that his prison breakdown, which could have been a huge tearjerker moment, didn't do much for me. The one truly remarkable thing I take from this one are the sheep. Obviously they're very early versions of Park's later work in Shaun the Sheep and Timmy Time, which I both enjoy a lot and would recommend over this one. They pretty much raise every scene they're in, especially the original one funnily being dressed in a pullover of its own wool for most of the movie.

Wallace is superlatively voiced by Peter Sallis, and it is pretty much a one-man show. I loved Gromit, and although he never speaks, his facial expressions are priceless. I loved the idea of Wallace thinking the moon was made of cheese, and the plot never ran out of steam.

Sheep that are lost, an evil dog robot, a girl that the main character falls in love it. It's all there. With intense scenes and a lot of drama! One of the key improvements was the amount of special effects done. Sure, most of it was pure clay on frame by frame with camera work. But they added some special effects to enhance the clay world and digital world together. Some include the sparks the sheep's chainsaw produced. And when the dog was flying. These were very great improvement! The thing that gets me is the main character's absolute lack of intelligence, and the dog's intellectual yet still emotional behavior.

Whether or not you liked or still like John Denver, or the crusty cigar-chomping curmugeon George Burns, this movie still has charm. It may reek of the middle 1970's back to the earth and spiritualism that pervaded the times, but it was nice to see a simple funny film that made you think ""what if"". It was perfectly cast and perfectly acted. JD was that grocery store clerk married and faithful and devoted to family and community. Yet he knew the world wasn't right and probably felt that he was just a nothing of a man and wanted nothing more than to do his job, raise his family and be nice to his neighbors (although many of them were not interested). And God chose him to deliver a message that you may or may not believe God would deliver, but it is still a good message of what a society should be or could be. And yet, people hear for a moment but still go back to thier ways.  And that is why this movie is still a light in the forest that can open your heart to the possibilities raised in the film. It may be a comedy and far-fetched but it still has a message, albeit delivered in a folksy Hee-haw style..yet it is still resonates with the child in all of us! See it when it",0.0
5214,"Cult Movies 40; 40. OH! GOD! (comedy, 1977) Jerry (John Denver) is an assistant-manager for a produce store. He's a happy family man until God (George Burns) requests an audience. He has picked Jerry to carry his message of good will to an increasingly pessimistic world. But Jerry finds that people are difficult to convince, he even has trouble trying to make his family understand that God appears to him as a kindly old man. Critique: A surprise box-office hit when first released, it spawned other sequels that proved interesting ('OH! GOD! BOOK 2', 'OH! GOD! YOU DEVIL'). 81 year old George Burns shines as the perennial God, a role that he played with sweet abandonment. He is given great lines to work with. This God seems to have an answer for everything: on creating the world he quips; ""to tell you the truth I thought about it for 6 days and did the whole thing in 1"". What's most interesting is that the film takes an unbiased, non-religious look at our Creator. This God doesn't believe in religions or its leaders, and sees ""human suffering"" as being our fault (not His doing) since we 'choose' to be. No wonder the very simple themes and in-jokes appealed to so many. QUOTE: Jerry: ""Sometimes, now and then, couldn't we just talk?"" God: ""Tell you what, you talk I'll listen.""",0.0
5214,"religious figures need to watch this movie; Historically, everyone has assumed that God is supposed to be associated with religion, and everyone claims the Almighty for their religions. Well, in ""Oh, God!"", the Big G is nothing like that. Grocery store clerk Jerry Landers (John Denver) gets a message that God wants to meet with him. Thinking the whole thing to be a joke at first, Jerry realizes that it really is the Creator, albeit only his voice. Later, God appears as an old man (George Burns), and explains that he wants Jerry to spread his word to humanity. He hasn't gone to any clerical figure (e.g., the pope or Billy Graham) because he's not interested in religion. But when Jerry tries to tell the world, they not only believe him to be crazy, but many people start threatening him. They certainly had a good point about God not being interested in religion. If more people would consider this concept and stop claiming that all of their actions are in God's name, maybe the world might come closer to moving forward in various arenas.",0.0
5214,"Comedy? Truth?; If you are looking for Biblical truth you will not find it in this film. It goes against all the Bible teaches about God. Jesus is the Son of God. Comedy is also lacking in this film. Cows an afterthought? God did not, nor does not have an afterthought. I know it was supposed to be humorous, but I did not laugh once. Some say this is much funnier than Bruce Almighty, but that is erroneous information. Bruce Almighty has many humorous moments, even Evan Almighty is funnier than Oh God. Sheeeeeeeeep !! This film does not wear its age well. It feels dated. The one good thing about this film is that you could use it as a cultural reference of the times. It has many things from the 70s which do not exist any longer. Tab? George Burns is definitely great in his role, as is Terri Garr, but John Denver is not an actor and it shows. He lacks charisma to carry the picture and does not have the comedic timing of the great comediennes of the 70s. I rate this 4/10 and i feel generous.",0.0

1223,"What a cracking start to a career; Wallace and Gromit are a phenomenon. How many stop motion animation films win Oscars, top the US and UK box office charts etc. But all that came later. A Grand Day Out was the first Wallace and Gromit film. Low budget. More or less a graduation piece. Of course the animation is less sophisticated than in the later films. Of course the plot is a little shallow. The entire story is designed to minimise the need for sophisticated animation and to maximise the excuse for shortcomings (perhaps dogs and people would move a bit like that on a cheese moon). Yet it is extraordinary to see how much of the Aardman genius is already there in this short film. Hilarious and clever references to other films. Mice in shades for take off. The rocket handbrake gag. Coin-operated machine gags (brilliantly recycled in Were-Rabbit BTW). And a machine (is it an Aga?) that daydreams about skiing when it sees Wallace's holiday magazines. Of course TWT, ACS and Were-Rabbit are better movies, but this film is so worth seeing as a sign of early genius and indeed in its own right as a crude but wonderful animated film.",1.0

Wallace the inventor and Gromit return as window cleaners working for Wallace's new love interest Wendoline Ramsbottom.

They don't know it, but Wendoline and her evil dog are sheep hustlers stealing their wool. The little sheep, Shaun, is also in their house eating everything he sees, well, and around to help. Preston the robot dog is brilliant animation and Wallace and Gromit are just classic comedy from Aardman Animations. They are now in their own full length movie as well!

745,Really good fun but stolen by the sheep; Wallace and Gromit are working as window cleaners when Wallace meets Wendolene Â– the owner of the local wool store and falls in love.  Gromit stumbles across a plot to kidnap sheep to make them into food but is framed for a sheep murder before he can do anything. Can Wallace get Gromit out of jail in time to foil the sheep rustlers? By this stage Christmas on the BBC was basically better known as the time when we get the new W&G film rather than for the birth of the son of God.  This film was THE focus for Christmas day Â– ITV did everything but stop broadcasting at the same time as this was on Â– who would want to compete with this?!  Happily it doesn't disappoint.  The plot is silly but incredibly well thought out and very imaginative. The comedy is as bright and breezy as ever Â– getting to kids without resorting to lazy clowning or stupid sight gags and also reaching adults without lacing the film with innuendo or hidden smut.  Instead it is just a clever mix of wit and humour that really hits the mark.  On Christmas Day it's easy to sit and doze through anything but this made me sit up and pay attention The characters are as good as ever.  As always Wallace is solid and wonderfully eccentric while Gromit is the real brains behind everything working.  Gromit is my favourite character but here he is upstaged by the oh-so-cute Shaun the sheep (on his way to a merchandising boom!).  Shaun is more for kids but Gromit still steals many scenes.  Wendolene (gettit?) is not so good and the scenes with Wallace and her don't work as well as the rest. Overall this is very funny despite just falling short of the mark set by `The Wrong Trousers'.  Word is Park is currently writing a W&G movie Â– I can't wait!!!!,1.0
1223,"Highly Recommended!...; Although the Aardman animation (or 'claymation' if you prefer) has improved over the years, I still really love the look and feel of this short. The voice of Peter Sallis as Wallace is perfectÂ… I couldn't imagine anyone else voicing the part. I find the comic timing works to a tea and the storyline is both wacky and brilliant. There are very few things that make me laugh out loud, but there are several jokes in this film that still crack me up even 22 years later! Long may the BBC keep showing it!

1223,"Hilarious...; ""Gromit, we've forgotten the crackers!"" Wallace and Gromit are very funny, very cute little claymation characters that go on adventures so that everybody can have a good time. In this short, they go to the moon, because everyone knows it's made out of cheese, and cheese is what they want. When they get there, it's a bit different than they expected, but that doesn't stop them from exploring around and running into a little mischief with a robot thing that happens to be left there (and take Earthling money, too...). It's quite a charming little duo, this Wallace and Gromit. Wallace is the inventor with a smile on his face and the plans to do whatever he fancies, while Gromit is his concerned protector, chasing after him to make sure his master is okay. The claymation is of the finest sort, with their expressions perfect and a lot of depth to their eyes. Just remember: don't forget the crackers. --PolarisDiB",1.0
5214,"A Thinly Veiled Metaphor for Stigmatization of the Mentally Ill; In this thinly veiled metaphor, the writer Larry Gelbart and director Carl Reiner explore the descent of a middle-aged man into psychosis. From the opening scenes, the main character Jerry Landers displays positive symptoms related to schizophrenia, such as delusional thinking, disordered thought, auditory, and eventually visual hallucinations. As is common in sufferers of schizophrenia, the delusions and hallucinations almost exclusively focus on themes of religiosity and grandiosity. After claiming to have conversations with God, Jerry's delusions expand further into beliefs that he is the Savior of man kind, sent to the spread the word of God and has the ability to talk with the Almighty. When sharing these thoughts and experiences with others, Jerry is often the butt of a joke within the community and among his peers. What is very sadly lost in the ""comedy"" surrounding Jerry's illness is the stigma that Jerry receives from his family and co-workers. After divulging the nature and subject matter of his hallucinations and delusions to his family, both Jerry's wife and children use discriminatory labels to describe his thoughts and behaviour such as ""crazy"" and ""bananas"". Despite having strong connections to psychiatric professionals, Jerry's family fails to get him the help he so sorely needs. Instead, the his wife and children express either extreme denial or a wish to no longer be associated with this kind of ""crazy"". Two heart-wrenching moments stand out in particular in regards to the stigma Jerry faces after his struggle with mental illness becomes public. First, Jerry is asked to appear on a late night talk show to speak about his hallucinations and delusions. Instead of seeking this as an opportunity to increase awareness and support for mental illness, the host of the talk show seems to find Jerry's severe symptoms amusing and coaxes him into situations where Jerry finds himself ridiculed for his ""crazy"" ideas. Second, after becoming alarmed by Jerry's behaviour and seeing the negative public exposure he is getting, Jerry's fictional employer ""Food World"" invites him to the corporate office where Jerry receives the height of prejudice and persecution. The supervisor asks Jerry to either ""stop"" his current public display of mental illness, or risk being demoted and eventually fired. Though early intervention may have helped Jerry, the refusal to recognize his illness as real and immediate forces him into a deeper psychotic state. He then feels himself pushed to confront a high level religious leader about his thoughts and this is where the story takes an even more drastic and terrible turn. Jerry finds himself the object of a court case, confronted not with sympathy but prosecution of his illness. During his court case, Jerry leaps deeper and more fully into a delusional state, convincing an ordinary witness that he himself is God on the stand. This causes such a commotion that court is then put into recess. It is through the kindness of an sympathetic judge that Jerry narrowly escapes legal action. However, in his parting words to Jerry, the judge states ""As much as 'we' feel what has happened here is real, God did not appear before us today"". Though these words may have been meant to nudge Jerry into recovery, they merely invalidate the experience of the schizophrenic patient. It would have seemed apt that at this point in the movie Jerry receive the help he so dearly deserved; however, the ending is more aligned with the reality that those with mental illness face. Jerry is released back into society untreated, and left to his own devices. It is sad to say that in spite of being made more than thirty years ago, this movie still resonates truths present for those suffering from mental illness today. Watch this movie with loved ones, friends and family, and open the discussion. No one should have to go through what Jerry did alone.",0.0
5214,"George Burns as a Libertarian God; George Burns picks an average Joe, the married assistant manager of a grocery store with two kids (John Denver as Jerry Landers) to put out the message that he is unhappy with the direction things are going, but that everything necessary to put things right is available on the earth and it is up to the people if things are going to change for the better. And Jerry doesn't even believe in God, at first anyways. Now maybe God was smart to pick an unbeliever, since he would have no preconceived notions of God, no childhood Sunday school lessons with which to fight what his eyes are telling him. But Jerry is confused by this Libertarian God. Think about it- Burns' interpretation of God definitely has an opinion of how things should go, but refuses to lift a finger to change anything. He believes the people should do the fixing and that He should have a ""hands off"" policy. Even after Jerry gets in trouble with his new role and risks his marriage, his career, even everything he owns in a lawsuit with a televangelist, and he and God are saying their goodbyes, God doesn't promise to do anything to help him repair the smoldering remains of his life. He just tells Jerry that he did a good job getting the message out and walks off. Yep, that sounds like the God I know. As for the acting, at the time George Burns did a guest appearance on the TV show Alice and mentioned he was picked for the lead because he ""was the only person old enough to play the part"". Burns did a great job of slinging the occasional zinger in the film like in his younger years playing straight man to Gracie. John Denver did a convincing job of playing a working stiff that just doesn't have time for this stuff but feels he must comply. What else do you do when God keeps picking you up in a taxi? And poor Terri Garr, she spent 1977 playing a housewife who is married to a modern day Moses in this film, and married to a guy making the replica of a mountain out of mashed potatoes in her den in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". Looking at it 40 years after the fact, the one thing that this film got right way ahead of its time was the crooked televangelist, artfully played by Paul Sorvino. So artfully I had forgotten that he was playing the part until I rewatched the film recently. God knows that the guy is enriching himself in his ministry, and his sermons never talk about morality, just the importance of giving. This was 14 years before Bob Tilton was exposed as a con artist on ABC's primetime live, 10 years before Jim Bakker was found to be running his ""Christian amusement park"" as a giant Ponzi scheme, and eleven years before Jimmy Swaggart was caught in an ongoing sex scandal even while condemning another dishonored pastor for his own.And as for Mike Murdock? Don't get me started. Let's just say that Paul Sorvino has the act down pat from the big hair to the rather colorful wardrobe to the Southern accent and fake politeness. It's a very quirky film, certainly with lots of made up feel good philosophy attributed to God, but it is fun, certainly different, and try making a film like that today with all of the political correctness in the air. I'd recommend it.",0.0
5214,"Gentle and enlightened; You certainly don't need to be a believer to enjoy this charming film; I'm an atheist and always have. John Denver gives a nice performance as the forthright and altruistic groceryman who is called upon by God to deliver His message, and an 81-year-old George Burns is perfect in the role of the Almighty. The film delivers what I think is appropriate criticism of organized religion, distinguishing it from faith, and Paul Sorvino is great (though a little over-the-top) as a southern televangelist. I also liked the Deist position it takes, that God created the world but it's up to mankind to make of it what it will, and that kindness and brotherhood are more important than dogma. The film doesn't try to answer all of the unanswerable questions, but it does take a pretty good crack at a lot of the big ones (Q: 'Why does God allow all the suffering in the world', A: 'I don't permit it, you do. Free will: all the choices are yours.' Q: 'Was Jesus Christ your son?' A: 'Jesus was my son. Buddha was my son. Muhammad, Moses, you, the man who said there was no room at the inn was my son.' Q: 'Which of the world's religions is closest to the divine truth?' A: 'The divine truth is not in a building or a book or a story. Put down the heart is the temple where all truth resides.') This is not a fire and brimstone God, or one bent on vengeance, hell, and eternal agony for sinners and nonbelievers; this is an informal, simple, and gentle God. How refreshing, and how enlightened.",0.0
5214,"Fun movie for that time period; This is an outdated movie for todays society. God is becoming less and less a part of our lives because ""it"" doesn't exist beyond our own imagination. This movie also is outdated with the message. Yes, it is a feel good movie, but it lacks a more universal appeal to all religions. It focuses on only Americans and Christianity. George Burns plays a great part as does the rest of the cast but watching this movie more than once is pointless. Although there are specific scenes where George Burns bitch-slaps some of the ""christian"" leaders for focusing on money and fame.

5214,"Simple, thought-provoking comedy with George Burns...; 1st watched 6/5/2010 -- 7 out of 10(Dir-Carl Reiner): Simple, thought-provoking comedy with George Burns playing the wise-cracking grandfather-like God character. The movie was written by television comedy writer Larry Gelbart and directed by TV icon Carl Reiner. John Denver, in his first acting role, plays the character who talks to God and has to convince everyone that he exists. There aren't really any huge laughs in this movie, but it has some funny parts and the movie and it's message are just genuinely appealing. The idea that a normal guy can be chosen by God to spread his simple message to the world is something we want to believe in. Denver's character is an assistant manager at a supermarket when he gets a letter to meet God for an interview on the 27th floor of a building that only has 17 floors. At first he only hears God's voice, but then he appears in the form of George Burns -- supposedly a form the character can understand -- and then tries to convince his wife and kids(unsuccessfully) and then others. God is eventually given a test which he answers and delivers to an evangelical preacher but also expresses that he's a phony. The preacher then sues him and sets up a courtroom scene where God reveals himself to others(in his own George Burns-like way, of course). This is a very well done simple movie done by a couple of TV icons who then were able to do bigger things in the film world because of the success of this movie. A low-key gem that's not perfect but well done and good for the whole family. Don't miss it.",0.0
5214,"Wholesome comedy; John Denver made his film debut with this wonderful wholesome comedy. He plays an ordinary supermarket worker who is honest and straightforward. He has a loving wife and 2 kids. God, out of the blue, picks him to spread the Word. Everyone is sceptical as Jerry Landers (Denver) tries to make believers out of them.     George Burns was a perfect choice to play the Almighty. John Denver doesn't sing in this film, but still comes off as an honest (if somewhat naive) person. The car he drives is definitely a 70's relic (the Pacer, I miss those!). Watching the scenes with just Burns and Denver strikes me as sad because they are no longer with us. The film is not too preachy (a plus in my book) and puts just a hint of humor in it all (like the courtroom scene).",0.0

He is patient, kind and easy to talk to-- everything that God is, in my humble opinion. I do like the fact that he is represented as less than perfect; he shows us the human side of our creator. John Denver is great as the grocery clerk, the naive, put-upon modern Moses who tries to convince everyone that he's not insane. The appeal of this film is the underlying message that God cares for us, and also the way the message is delivered in such a non-denominational, non-preachy, non-judgmental manner. Its a fun movie that reminds us that God is always watching us---not to squash us like a bug when we make a mistake, but to be there for us when we need him.

I agree that the characters are not as developed as they were in 'The Wrong Trousers' or 'A Close Shave' and also the plot is weaker.  Some of the models are not as refined as they came to be (this is after all the first W&G film). What it has that the other W&G offerings lack is that feeling of sadness and mood that the 'The Wrong Trousers' and 'A Close Shave' replace with story telling.  This is closer to Tom and Jerry than it is to Chicken Run.  It has laughs sure, but the feeling I have when the credits role is of one of wistfulness and a slight melancholy.

745,"Millions of Brits...; tuned in to watch 'A Close Shave' on Christmas Day 1995, the result of three years of hard labour by Nick Park and his team and follow-up to the amazing 'The Wrong Trousers'. Again, we are reacquainted with the somewhat eccentric and VERY British inventor Wallace and his trusted, sane sidekick, Gromit the Dog. And amazingly, this time the standard of animation is even higher than his previous effort. Where 'The Wrong Trousers' had Hitchcock as spiritual father- the rather dark tale of a mysterious *penguin* that takes over Gromits place in the house, woos Wallace and uses his inventions for its evil purpose- 'A Close Shave' has a much lighter air, more Spielberg if you may. This time we get even more chase scenes, more jokes, more references to TV-shows, movies than in earlier W&G outings and goodness, there's even some love in the air for Wallace. Repeated viewing is rewarding, as to really appreciate the attention to detail and small sight-gags. Already mentioned by previous posters but the expression on the faces is dead-on, especially for Gromit, who because of a lack of vocal chords, must fully rely on his body language to drive home the point. Word has it that Park is working on a W&G feature for Dreamworks, bugger that it takes ages to produce one of these babies though. Hopefully this will show the true genius of Park and co., whereas their first feature 'Chicken Run', although still very entertaining, felt somewhat lacking.

745,"Thrilling, exciting, hilarious, touching...plasticine; Just thinking about stop motion animation makes one think of a slow and tedious process of moving everything in the frame scene by scene. It takes forever (seemingly), and just two years after Wallace and Gromit's last adventure, we get this superbly animated, well thought out short film, that is actually as exciting as many live action adventure pictures. Proof that Nick Park and crew are about quality, because after the success of ""the Wrong Trousers"" it would be easy to cash in on a less than great installment, but thankfully for us, that's not the case. A mysterious wool shortage has plagued the town where Wallace and Gromit, who are now cleaning windows, live. What lies before this man and dog duo is a love interest, a sheep rustling murderous dog, and a lot of sheep. When thinking of the original three Wallace and Gromit shorts, I've always put this one and the Wrong Trousers nearly on par as perfect shorts, and while I still feel that way, this one falls a little short of their second adventure, and yet this has nothing really wrong with it to make it worse. When you have two perfect shorts, one is going to probably be favored over the other, and the lack of talking and pure clay animated suspense that ""Wrong Trousers"" produced stands above this equally wonderful, but more grandiose outing. Either way, this is seriously great, and one of the greatest short films out there. The animation has improved greatly since ""The Wrong Trousers"". The animation is smoother, the sets are more three dimensional and the town in which they live in is given more of a personality, and fingerprints aren't as prominent on the figures. And the animation on the action sequences is superb. The last film gave us the hilarious train sequence, and this one gives us many action sequences, most notably being the motorcycle chase and the oatmeal machine gun shootout which are both spectacular and hilariously implausible. The whole five (or so) minute chase scene in the film is seriously as interesting, well thought out, and action packed as most regular action flicks, and it manages to be so without any violence or explosions. Truly a testament to the writing and animation of this thing. Composer Julian Nott is also a huge part of this film. His music sounds like a mix of suspenseful thriller music, and a German polka...an unlikely combination, but one that fits so perfectly, giving the scenes a playful bounce, along with a ""something bad is going to happen"" feel. A new addition to the score for this film that wasn't in the previous two was the love theme which is almost a parody of love themes, but one that stands on it's own and also works perfectly in the scenes. Wallace and Gromit represent not just quality animation, but also top notch writing, well thought out jokes and gags, fantastic direction from Nick Park, and proof that animation is not just for kids. Nick Park and the team at Aardman animation can easily be thought of as the Pixar team of England. My rating: **** out of ****. 31 mins. Not rated, but good for the whole family.",1.0
745,"A very confusing mess.; I have no idea what I have just seen.After the first two Wallace and Gromit shorts I had high expectations for the third.I couldn't have been more disappointed.For some reason W & G are window cleaners this time.By the time you stop thinking about that, it's too late to just turn it off.Wallace falls in love with the owner of a wool shop whose windows they clean.Her name is Wendolene Ramsbottom and I'm not sure how I feel about that.On one hand I get that it's a genius joke, naming her after a window cleaning product and an animal that is similar to a sheep.At the same time it doesn't make any sense because she doesn't clean windows and no one gets wool from rams.Maybe I'm over thinking her name but it's the most interesting thing about this short.My least favorite thing about this is that they take the newspaper joke from The Wrong Trousers and use it to death, without it ever being funny.I heard they made a Shaun The Sheep movie and I shudder to think what it may be like.Kids might enjoy this but it's definitely not for everyone.Anyone over 10 should pass on this.",1.0
745,"Close to perfect.; Even though the story is probably less impressive- and overdone when compared to the other Wallace & Gromit shorts, it still probably is my favorite. It's simply such a fine and entertaining movie to watch, not in the least because it has Preston, the evil villain dog in it and a whole bunch of sheep. It's an impressive looking movie, with some surprising big sequences. What I always love about the Wallace & Gromit movies is that they often feature some amazing build-up and shot action sequences and chases in particular. It's often worth the price alone already. This was the second Wallace & Gromit short to win an Oscar for best animated short, which not only proofs the quality and entertainment level of the Wallace & Gromit shorts but shows as well that you don't need a big budget or impressive new techniques to make a brilliant animated movie with. The claymation is impressive as always and has lots of details to it. It must be an incredibly time consuming but also incredibly rewarding process to make a movie like this. Nick Park must surely enjoy it. He's in the claymation business for over 20 years now, together with Peter Lord. This movie takes some chance to add another human character to the movie. All of the previous Wallace & Gromit movies were mostly purely about the strange friendship between the man and dog, in which the dog always seemed like the more clever and rational of the two. This gamble however worked out fine for the movie and the added love-story plot actually adds a lot to the movie. As a matter of fact, after this movie Wallace had many more love-interests in later Wallace & Gromit adventures, such as the big theatrical released ""Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" and the latest short ""Wallace and Gromit in 'A Matter of Loaf and Death'"". It of course are not just the human characters that make this movie but also really the animals. Preston the dog is such a great and evil movie villain. The sheep in this movie also provide the movie with lots of hilarious moments and they are cute looking as well. perhaps my favorite Wallace & Gromit short. 9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",1.0

Wallace and Gromit is a real genuine classic and I know many will agree. It may have had a few years break with the creators doing other things like 'Chicken Run' and 'Creature Comforts' but Wallace and Gromit exceeds them all! Don't get me wrong Chicken Run is great but it belongs to a different generation of children and I can't regard it with the same affection as I regard W+G. (Ah here comes a spoiler sorry folks)and isn't shawn just sooooooooooooo cute! I think this is their creators best achievement, I even still find it a bit scary at times lol... 10/10 lads! Sorry this is a bit short (well it's short for me anyway) but I just wanted to say how special I think Wallace and Gromit really is and hope it continues to be enjoyed by generations to come because in my eyes Wallace and Gromit can never die!",1.0
745,"The Third And Final Classic Of The Series!; Wallace And Gromit In A Close Shave is the third and final of The Classic Wallace And Gromit adventures which I own on BBC Children's Videos. Not to be confused with The Classic Thomas The Tank Engine Story involving Duck crashing into a Barbar's shop, this version of A Close Shave involves Wallace And Gromit becoming window cleaners, where Wallace finds the love of his life. Her name is Wendeline and she works in a knitting shop where customers buy wool (and yes, this short film involves a lot of sheep!) her dog ""Preston"" is up to some tricks and it is up to Wallace And Gromit to save the sheep! The film has a lot of memorable moments, such as Wallace finding the love of his life and realising she is not right for him (because of her dislike of cheese!) and this film also introduces us to Shaun (before he gets a TV series of his own!) Along with the first two Wallace And Gromit short films, this will be almost impossible to not enjoy! Overall Rating: 10/10!",1.0
